A two-week state of emergency has been declared.\n\nPresident Michel Aoun said the blast was caused by 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate stored unsafely in a warehouse.\n\nAll port officials have been put under house arrest pending an investigation.\n\nCustoms chief Badri Daher told local media that his agency had repeatedly called for the ammonium nitrate to be removed, but \"this did not happen, and we leave it to the experts to determine the reasons\".\n\nAmmonium nitrate is used as a fertiliser in agriculture and as an explosive.\n\nOpening an emergency cabinet meeting, President Aoun said: \"No words can describe the horror that has hit Beirut last night, turning it into a disaster-stricken city\".\n\nThe explosion occurred just after 18:00 (15:00 GMT) after a fire at the port, and it was felt 240km (150 miles) away on the island of Cyprus, in the eastern Mediterranean.\n\nWhat is the latest on rescue efforts?\n\nSecurity forces have sealed off a wide area around the blast site, and rescuers have been looking for bodies and survivors under rubble while boats searched the waters off the coast.\n\nHowever the overnight rescue effort was hampered by a lack of electricity.\n\nPublic Health Minister Hamad Hassan said Lebanon's health sector was short of beds and lacked the equipment necessary to treat the injured and care for patients in critical condition.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Beirut explosion: The moment blast hit BBC bureau caught in interview\n\nHe said a \"large number of children\" had been rescued but added that he feared that the number of dead would rise further.\n\nThe Saint Georges hospital near the site of the explosion was badly damaged and several members of staff were killed. Three Beirut hospitals were closed with two others only partially operational, the World Health Organization (WHO) said. The body said it would airlift medical supplies to Lebanon on Wednesday evening.\n\nThree French planes are due to arrive carrying 55 rescuers, medical equipment and a mobile clinic equipped to treat 500 people. French President Emmanuel Macron will visit on Thursday. The EU is sending 100 firefighters with vehicles, dogs and equipment. Russia is sending five planes carrying rescuers, doctors and equipment.\n\nMeanwhile, many buildings and homes have been reduced to an uninhabitable mess of glass and as many as 300,000 people have been left homeless, Beirut's governor Marwan Aboud said.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Rami Ruhayem has been to Gemmayze, the closest residential area to the port where the explosion happened\n\nWhat triggered the explosion?\n\nThe ammonium nitrate had reportedly been in a warehouse in Beirut port for six years after it was unloaded from a ship impounded at the port in 2013.\n\nThe head of Beirut port and the head of the customs authority both told local media that they had written to the judiciary several times asking that the chemical be exported or sold on to ensure port safety.\n\nThe port's General Manager Hassan Koraytem told OTV that they had been aware that the material was dangerous when a court first ordered it stored in the warehouse, \"but not to this degree\".\n\nLebanon's Supreme Defence Council has vowed that those found responsible will face the \"maximum punishment\" possible.\n\nEconomy Minister Raoul Nehme told the BBC: \"I think it is incompetence and really bad management and there are a lot of responsibilities from management and probably previous governments. We do not intend after such an explosion to stay silent on who is responsible for what.\"\n\nBritish former intelligence officer Philip Ingram told the BBC's Today programme that ammonium nitrate could only be turned into an explosive substance under certain circumstances.\n\nMr Ingram said that safely stored it was relatively safe but that in confined space and when contaminated with items such as fuel oil it could cause an explosion.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption The port area was largely flattened\n\nThe ammonium nitrate arrived on a Moldovan-flagged ship, the Rhosus, which entered Beirut port after suffering technical problems during its voyage from Georgia to Mozambique, according to Shiparrested.com, which deals with shipping-related legal cases.\n\nThe Rhosus was inspected, banned from leaving and was shortly afterwards abandoned by its owners, sparking several legal claims. Its cargo was then removed and stored in a port warehouse for safety reasons, the report said.\n\nAmmonium nitrate\n\nImage copyright Reuters\n\nCommon industrial chemical used mainly as fertiliser in agriculture\n\nAlso one of the main components in explosives used in mining\n\nNot explosive on its own, ignites only under the right circumstances\n\nWhen it explodes, it can release toxic gases including nitrogen oxides and ammonia gas\n\nStrict rules on how to store it safely: site has to be fire-proofed, and not have any drains, pipes or other channels in which ammonium nitrate could build up\n\nWhat's the background?\n\nThe explosion comes at a sensitive time for Lebanon. With Covid-19 infections on the rise, hospitals were already struggling to cope. Now, they are faced with treating thousands of injured people.\n\nThe country is also going through the worst economic crisis since the 1975-1990 civil war, and tensions were already high with street demonstrations against the government.\n\nMany blame the ruling elite who have dominated politics for years and amassed their own wealth while failing to carry out the sweeping reforms necessary to solve the country's problems. People have to deal with daily power cuts, a lack of safe drinking water and limited public healthcare.\n\nLebanon imports most of its food and large quantities of grain stored in the port have been destroyed causing fears of widespread food insecurity to come. The future of the port itself is in doubt due to the destruction caused.\n\nPresident Aoun announced that the government would release 100 billion lira (\u00a350.5m; $66m) of emergency funds but the impact of the blast on the economy is expected to be long-lasting.\n\nThe explosion happened close to the scene of a huge car bombing which killed former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri in 2005. A verdict is due in the trial of four men accused of orchestrating the attack on Mr Hariri at a special court in the Netherlands.\n\nHave you been personally affected by this story?

Last week's criticised how hospital patients were discharged to care homes without a Covid test.\n\nThat and today's report amount to the same accusation - poor or inexplicable decisions that didn't help slow the march of the pandemic.\n\nThe MPs cite examples from around the world where countries were requiring passengers arriving in that country to comply with stringent quarantine or monitoring measures.\n\nThe government insists that its general message from 13 March to the public to stay at home, if they had symptoms, worked.\n\nBut that recommendation was not the same as clear guidance, or an absolute legal requirement, for passengers to self-isolate even if they were feeling perfectly well.\n\nAnd that, say the MPs, meant travellers in March were able to arrive and move about much more freely at a critical moment in the spread of the virus across the UK.\n\nThe committee added that the decision to withdraw self-isolation advice was \"very different from countries in similar circumstances\".\n\nIt concluded that countries that instead introduced tougher border measures, such as Singapore, had been \"proved justified in doing so\".\n\nIt said an official estimate used to justify the UK's approach -

Two of the new locations are in the Antarctic Peninsula region, three are in the West of the continent and six in the East.\n\nThey are all in gaps between existing colonies. Emperor groups, it seems, like to keep at least 100km between themselves. The new sites maintain this distancing discipline.\n\nImage copyright Christopher Walton Image caption Emperor penguins need a reliable and stable platform of sea-ice\n\nIt's impossible to count individual penguins from orbit but the BAS researchers can estimate numbers in colonies from the size of the birds' huddles.\n\n\"It's good news because there are now more penguins than we thought,\" said BAS remote-sensing specialist Dr Peter Fretwell.\n\n\"But this story comes with a strong caveat because the newly discovered sites are not in what we call the refugia - areas with stable sea-ice, such as in the Weddell Sea and the Ross Sea. They are all in more northerly, vulnerable locations that will likely lose their sea-ice,\" he told BBC News.\n\nBreeding success for Emperors rests upon the presence of so-called \"fast ice\". This is the sea-ice that sticks to the edge of the continent or to icebergs.\n\nIt's low and flat, and an ideal surface on which to lay an egg, incubate it and then raise the subsequent chick in its first year of life.\n\nBut this seasonal ice needs to be long-lived, to stay intact for at least eight or nine months to be useful.\n\nIf it forms too late or breaks up too early, the young birds will be forced into the sea before they're ready, before they've lost their down and grown water-proof feathers.\n\nLikewise for the adults. They undergo a dramatic moult in the summer months of January and February. They too risk drowning if the fast ice melts away and they don't have the right plumage to resume swimming.\n\nAntarctic sea-ice trends in recent decades have been pretty stable, albeit with some big regional shifts. But the climate models foresee significant losses this century.\n\nEven under the Paris Agreement's best-case scenario with a global temperature increase of no more than 1.5C above pre-industrial times, the population is likely to decrease by at least a third over the next three generations, the experts say.\n\nImage copyright Copernicus Data/Sentinel/Esa Image caption The largest of the new colonies is at Cape Gates with several thousand breeding pairs\n\nIt's this troubling outlook that led researchers last year to call for the conservation status of Emperors to be upgraded.\n\nAt the moment, they are classified as \"Near Threatened\" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the organisation that keeps the lists of Earth's endangered animals.\n\nA proposal has now been submitted to put Emperors into the more urgent \"Vulnerable\" category.\n\nDetails of the Sentinel search for Emperors is reported in the journal Remote Sensing in Ecology and Conservation\n\nImage copyright BAS\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"}, {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-53662051", "published": "2020-08-05T08:24:02", "title": "Police dog finds missing mum and baby on first shift", "text": "Image copyright Dyfed-Powys Police Image caption Max\u2019s new job involves tracking and locating people and detaining suspects\n\nA police dog found a missing mother and toddler on his first operational shift.\n\nNewly-licensed Dyfed-Powys Police dog Max discovered the pair on the edge of a ravine in a remote part of Powys on Saturday.\n\nThe mother and her one-year-old had not been seen for two days and had spent the night outdoors.\n\nLed by the two-year-old German Shepherd cross who joined the force in February, handler PC Peter Lloyd spotted the woman waving for help at 13:30 BST.\n\nThey were helped down and checked over by a mountain rescue doctor and the ambulance service.\n\nInsp Jonathan Rees-Jones said: \"The woman had not been seen or spoken to for two days, which was out of character, and her phone wasn't working, so naturally concern for her safety was high.\"\n\nHe said the woman's car had been found on a mountain road which gave officers a location to search from, but there was still \"a vast area to cover given the amount of time she had been missing\".\n\n\"Despite only recently becoming licensed, and on his first operational shift, he immediately commenced an open area search,\" he said.\n\nAfter an hour-and-a-half of searching involving Brecon Mountain Rescue Team, a National Police Air Service (NPAS) helicopter and a search expert, the mother and baby were found.\n\n'Safe but cold'\n\n\"They were safe, but cold, and appeared to have been in the area for a significant amount of time,\" he said.\n\n\"I must give a special mention to PC Pete Lloyd and Max, who on their very first day since completing their training together covered a significant amount of mileage in the search, eventually locating them safe.\"\n\nPC Lloyd said he was \"really pleased\", adding: \"Max remained focussed throughout the long search and he proved invaluable.\""}, {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-53666222", "published": "2020-08-05T12:07:13", "title": "Tesla touchscreen wiper controls land driver with fine after crash", "text": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nTesla's touchscreen car controls should be treated as a distracting electronic device, a German court has decided.\n\nA driver found himself facing a road ban after being involved in a crash in the rain.\n\nThe Tesla automatically started its wipers - but manually controlling the speed was done through the large central touchscreen, rather than a lever on the steering wheel.\n\nThe driver was punished under the same rules as using a phone while driving.\n\nThe Tesla Model 3 automatically adjusts the speed of the wipers depending on how heavy its sensors believe the rain is.\n\nIt can be switched on and off from the steering wheel, but adjusting the interval needs to be done on the touchscreen.\n\nIn this case, the driver had to navigate software menus and then choose from one of five settings, after touching an icon.\n\nThe accident occurred last year.

Here are seven reasons not to give up on poetry.\n\n1. Reading diverse voices\n\nThe Poetry Society, which promotes the study, use and enjoyment of poetry, has said it is important to recognise that poetry provides \"a lot of the diversity\" in the GCSE English curriculum.\n\n\"This is where students encounter the voices of writers of colour like John Agard and Imtiaz Dharker, Raymond Antrobus and Zaffar Kunial,\" the organisation's director Judith Palmer told the BBC.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Poet, playwright, short story and children's writer John Agard, who was born in Guyana and came to Britain in the 1970s\n\nShe said poetry anthologies had been kept updated to include recent works that \"speak directly to young people's lived experience\" and urged people not to \"scrimp on the poetry\".\n\n\"All the research that we do with young people comes back showing that they are desperate to read more diverse writers, and that this increases and widens engagement,\" she said.\n\n2. Discussing challenging subjects\n\nExams watchdog Ofqual said it had decided to offer students a choice of topics, following concerns that it was hard for them \"to get to grips with complex literary texts remotely\".\n\nBut Ms Palmer also stressed that the study of poetry \"opens up a space for the discussion of challenging subjects such as loss and isolation\".\n\n\"In these Covid times, poetry has never been more relevant,\" she said, noting that many students returning to the classroom will be processing trauma.\n\nShe added: \"All our usual certainties have recently been washed away. Poetry is all about uncertainty.\n\n\"It doesn't give answers, it poses questions, and helps students understand that life may involve learning to live with complexities.\"\n\n3. 'Teens read and write more poetry every year'\n\nWriters have also responded to the changes, including Scottish writer and teacher Kate Clanchy. She tweeted that dropping poetry at GCSE \"sends a signal down the school that it's the dispensable bit of English\".\n\nMs Clanchy, who regularly shares her students' poems on Twitter, insisted: \"Poetry is core, and teenagers read and write more of it every year.\"\n\nShe called for the return of open book examinations as an alternative way to relieve pressure on students.\n\n4. The power of poetry\n\nMeanwhile, British-born Cypriot poet and writer Anthony Anaxagorou said poems \"do so much more\" than other ways of using language.\n\n\"Poetry shouldn't be regarded as an analytical exercise, a response to memory, a means of introducing literary device,\" he tweeted.\n\n\"Poems do so much more, getting into spaces [and] subjects other modes of language can't.\n\n\"Presenting it as an 'option' does nothing but reduce its cultural value more.\"\n\n5. Poetry 'will always have a mainstay in pop culture'\n\nWilson Oryema, a multidisciplinary artist and writer from London, is among a new generation of poets who have adopted the form in the digital age by sharing work on social media.\n\nThis movement comes alongside the growth of performance poetry and spoken word - led by artists such as Kate Tempest and George the Poet - bringing new audiences to poetry.\n\nHe told the BBC poetry will always \"have a mainstay in popular culture\".\n\n\"Social platforms have created a whole new way for interacting and creating poetry,\" said Mr Oryema, who shares his work on Instagram, said.\n\nHe added: \"Now there's a quick consumer culture it's very rare that people read long books anymore. It's usually just quick interactions [...] so I think poetry is one of the best mediums we have for communicating our ideas.\n\n\"Poetry holds value for so many people and it is a form of expression that has been used for centuries. As more people interact with these mediums, either to type poems or create videos, I can't see it slowing down, only increasing.\"\n\n6. Coping with lockdown\n\nBack in April, Game of Thrones star Emilia Clarke told fans that poetry had helped her cope with isolation during lockdown.\n\nIn a moving video posted on Instagram, she read aloud from a collection called the Poetry Pharmacy by William Sieghart, which presents poems as prescriptions for various states of mind.\n\nHer chosen poem dealt with loneliness because, as she put it, \"isolation is a funny thing\".\n\nShe asked fellow actors to do the same for a series she called \"poetry pharmacy goodness for the time of Isolation and Covid\".\n\nHelena Bonham-Carter read one prescribed for self-blame, and Stephen Fry for depression. Andrew Scott said his poem addressed the need for reassurance and Thandi Newton said hers was for those struggling with inertia.\n\n7. Poetry for the NHS\n\nPoetry also brought people together in a shared appreciation for health workers during the pandemic. Front-line workers contributed poems about their experiences to two anthologies that raised money for NHS charities.\n\nPoems for a Pandemic by Angela Marston sought to explore a \"global effort to rescue humanity from the teeth of an invisible enemy\", while Kate Amiel and Deborah Alma's These are the Hands - named after the Michael Rosen poem - was described as \"crystallising the most beautiful and painful moments of being human\".\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption BBC presenter Sophie Raworth reads These Are The Hands by Michael Rosen\n\nIn the foreword of the latter, children's author and poet Mr Rosen - who was seriously ill with coronavirus himself - praised the fact that the anthology featured NHS workers' poems alongside contributions from well-known poets.\n\n\"There is no place for us to say that because, let's say, you're a nurse you can't also be a poet,\" he wrote.\n\n\"Quite the opposite: we need poems by people who do things other than write poems! We need to be able to talk to each other and listen to each other in the way that this collection enables us to do.\"\n\nAt a glance: GCSE English literature poetry\n\nGCSE specifications for English literature in England require students to study a selection of poetry since 1789, including the Romantics.\n\nTo give an example, the AQA exam board says students should study 15 poems from the AQA poetry anthology, which includes writers such as Byron, Maura Dooley, Seamus Heaney, Daljit Nagra, William Wordsworth, Simon Armitage and Jane Weir.\n\nThere is also an unseen poetry section of the exam, for which AQA says students should experience a wide range of poetry in order to develop their ability to closely analyse unseen poems."}, {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-53654338", "published": "2020-08-04T16:17:41", "title": "Sony's Spider-Man exclusive sparks backlash", "text": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A Spider-Man sculpture seen at a Barcelona gaming festival last year\n\nThe upcoming Marvel Avengers game has sparked a backlash after it was revealed that Spider-Man will only be in the PlayStation version.\n\nIts developer said the web-slinger will be available as downloadable content (DLC) next year on one platform only.\n\nThe game will be released on 4 September across several platforms including PS4, Xbox One and PC.\n\nFans have suggested the move will see many players missing out on the game's full experience.\n\nSony has owned the movie rights to Spider-Man since 1999, and a video game headlined by the web-slinger - Marvel's Spider-Man - was a PlayStation 4 exclusive in 2018.\n\nHowever, the superhero has appeared in other games on multiple consoles and PC over the years, including titles based on The Amazing Spider-Man film and its 2014 sequel.\n\nNumerous fans shared their outrage on social media following the surprise announcement on Monday.\n\n\"As a PS and PC player, I'll just be skipping Avengers altogether now.

By Tom Edgington\n\nBBC News Published duration 2 hours ago\n\nimage copyright Reuters image caption An ammonium nitrate explosion can release toxic gases\n\nNearly 3,000 tonnes of ammonium nitrate - taken from a ship off the coast of Beirut six years ago and then stored in a warehouse - has been blamed for the explosion that ripped through the port area of the Lebanese capital on Tuesday.\n\nBut what is ammonium nitrate and why can it be so dangerous?\n\nWhat is ammonium nitrate?\n\nAmmonium nitrate is a crystal-like white solid which is made in large industrial quantities. Its biggest use is as a source of nitrogen for fertiliser, but it is also used to create explosives for mining.\n\n\"You won't just find ammonium nitrate in the ground,\" explains Andrea Sella, professor of chemistry at University College London. That's because it's synthetic, made by reacting ammonia with nitric acid, he says.\n\nAmmonium nitrate is made all over the world and is relatively cheap to buy.\n\nBut storing it can be a problem, and it has been associated with serious industrial accidents in the past.\n\nHow dangerous is ammonium nitrate?\n\nOn its own, ammonium nitrate is relatively safe to handle, says Prof Sella.\n\nHowever, if you have a large amount of material lying around for a long time it begins to decay.\n\n\"The real problem is that over time it will absorb little bits of moisture and it eventually turns into an enormous rock,\" he says.

Instead of a glitzy studio or fashionable city street, the backdrop is a bare room with grubby walls and steel mesh on the window. And in place of the posing, Mr Ghappar sits silently with an anxious expression on his face.\n\nHolding the camera with his right hand, he reveals his dirty clothes, his swollen ankles, and a set of handcuffs fixing his left wrist to the metal frame of the bed - the only piece of furniture in the room.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The video Uighur model Merdan Ghappar filmed inside China's detention system\n\nThe video of Mr Ghappar, along with a number of accompanying text messages also passed to the BBC, together provide a chilling and extremely rare first-hand account of China's highly secure and secretive detention system - sent directly from the inside.\n\nThe material adds to the body of evidence documenting the impact of China's fight against what it calls the \"three evil forces\" of separatism, terrorism, and extremism in the country's far western region of Xinjiang.\n\nOver the past few years, credible estimates suggest, more than one million Uighurs and other minorities have been forced into a network of highly secure camps in Xinjiang that China has insisted are voluntary schools for anti-extremism training.\n\nThousands of children have been separated from their parents and, recent research shows, women have been forcibly subjected to methods of birth control.\n\nIn addition to the clear allegations of torture and abuse, Mr Ghappar's account appears to provide evidence that, despite China's insistence that most re-education camps have been closed, Uighurs are still being detained in significant numbers and held without charge.\n\nIt also contains new details about the huge psychological pressure placed on Uighur communities, including a document he photographed which calls on children as young as 13 to \"repent and surrender\".\n\nImage caption Part of a document sent by Merdan Ghappar calling on children to 'repent and surrender'\n\nAnd with Xinjiang currently experiencing a spike in the number of coronavirus infections, the dirty and crowded conditions he describes highlight the serious risk of contagion posed by this kind of mass detention during a global pandemic.\n\nThe BBC sent detailed requests for comment to the Chinese Foreign Ministry and Xinjiang authorities but neither responded.\n\nMr Ghappar's family, who have not heard from him since the messages stopped five months ago, are aware that the release of the four minute, thirty-eight second video of him in his cell might increase the pressure and punishment he faces.\n\nBut they say it is their last hope, both to highlight his case and the plight of the Uighurs in general.\n\nHis uncle, Abdulhakim Ghappar, who now lives in the Netherlands, believes the video could galvanise public opinion in the same way that footage of the police treatment of George Floyd became a powerful symbol of racial discrimination in the US.\n\n\"They have both faced brutality for their race,\" he says.\n\n\"But while in America people are raising their voices, in our case there is silence.\"\n\nIn 2009, Merdan Ghappar - like many Uighurs at that time - left Xinjiang to seek opportunity in China's wealthier cities in the east.\n\nHaving studied dance at Xinjiang Arts University, he found work first as a dancer and then, a few years later, as a model in the southern Chinese city of Foshan. Friends say Mr Ghappar could earn up to 10,000 Rmb (\u00a31,000) per day.\n\nHis story reads like an advert for the country's dynamic, booming economy and President Xi Jinping's \"China Dream\". But the Uighurs, with their Turkic language, Islamic faith and ethnic ties to the peoples and cultures of central Asia, have long been viewed as an object of suspicion by Chinese rulers and faced discrimination in wider society.\n\nMr Ghappar's relatives say that Mr Ghappar was told it would be best for his modelling career to downplay his Uighur identity and refer to his facial features as \"half-European\".\n\nImage copyright Wu Zi Yang Agency Image caption Merdan Ghappar moved from Xinjiang in 2009 to pursue a modelling career\n\nAnd although he had earned enough money to buy a sizeable apartment, they say he was unable to register it in his own name, instead having to use the name of a Han Chinese friend.\n\nBut those injustices now seem mild by comparison with what was to come.\n\nEver since two brutal attacks targeting pedestrians and commuters in Beijing in 2013 and the city of Kunming in 2014 - blamed by China on Uighur separatists - the state has begun to view Uighur culture as not only suspicious but seditious.\n\nBy 2018, when the state had come up with its answer - the sprawling system of camps and jails built rapidly and extensively across Xinjiang - Mr Ghappar was still living in Foshan, where his life was about to take an abrupt turn for the worse.\n\nIn August that year, he was arrested and sentenced to 16 months in prison for selling cannabis, a charge his friends insist was trumped up.\n\nWhether truly guilty or not, there was little chance of an acquittal, with statistics showing that more than 99% of defendants brought before Chinese criminal courts are convicted.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Up to a million Muslims are thought to have been detained in prison camps across Xinjiang\n\nBut, upon his release in November 2019, any relief he felt at having served his time was short lived. Little more than a month later, police knocked on his door, telling him he needed to return to Xinjiang to complete a routine registration procedure.\n\nThe BBC has seen evidence that appears to show he was not suspected of any further offence, with authorities simply stating that \"he may need to do a few days of education at his local community\" - a euphemism for the camps.\n\nOn 15 January this year, his friends and family were allowed to bring warm clothes and his phone to the airport, before he was put on a flight from Foshan and escorted by two officers back to his home city of Kucha in Xinjiang.\n\nThere is evidence of other Uighurs being forced to return home, either from elsewhere in China or from abroad, and Mr Ghappar's family were convinced that he had disappeared into the re-education camps.\n\nBut more than a month later they received some extraordinary news.\n\nSomehow, he had managed to get access to his phone and was using it to communicate with the outside world.\n\nMerdan Ghappar's text messages, said to have been sent from the same room as his self-shot video, paint an even more terrifying picture of his experience after arriving in Xinjiang.\n\nWritten via the Chinese social media app WeChat, he explains that he was first kept in a police jail in Kucha.\n\n\"I saw 50 to 60 people detained in a small room no bigger than 50 square metres, men on the right, women on the left,\" he writes.\n\n\"Everyone was wearing a so-called 'four-piece-suit', a black head sack, handcuffs, leg shackles and an iron chain connecting the cuffs to the shackles.\"\n\nChina's use of these combined hand and leg cuffs has been criticised in the past by human rights groups.\n\nMr Ghappar was made to wear the device and, joining his fellow inmates in a caged-off area covering around two-thirds of the cell, he found there was no room to lie down and sleep.\n\n\"I lifted the sack on my head and told the police officer that the handcuffs were so tight they hurt my wrists,\" he writes in one of the text messages.\n\n\"He shouted fiercely at me, saying 'If you remove your hood again, I will beat you to death'. And after that I dared not to talk,\" he adds.\n\n\"Dying here is the last thing I want.\"\n\nHe writes about the constant sound of screaming, coming from elsewhere in the jail. \"Interrogation rooms,\" he suggested.\n\nAnd he describes squalid and unsanitary conditions - inmates suffering from lice while sharing just a handful of plastic bowls and spoons between them all.\n\n\"Before eating, the police would ask people with infectious diseases to put their hands up and they'd be the last to eat,\" he writes.\n\n\"But if you want to eat earlier, you can remain silent. It's a moral issue, do you understand?\"\n\nThen, on 22 January, with China at the height of its coronavirus crisis, news of a massive, nationwide attempt to control the epidemic reached the prisoners.\n\nMr Ghappar's account suggests the enforcement of quarantine rules were much stricter in Xinjiang than elsewhere. At one point, four young men, aged between 16 and 20, were brought into the cell.\n\n\"During the epidemic period they were found outside playing a kind of game like baseball,\" he writes.\n\n\"They were brought to the police station and beaten until they screamed like babies, the skin on their buttocks split open and they couldn't sit down.\"\n\nThe policemen began making all the prisoners wear masks, although they still had to remain hooded in the stuffy, over-crowded cell.\n\n\"A hood and a mask - there was even less air,\" he writes.\n\nWhen the officers later came around with thermometers, several inmates including Mr Ghappar, registered higher than the normal body temperature of 37C (98.6F).\n\nStill wearing his \"four-piece suit\", he was moved upstairs to another room where the guards kept the windows open at night, making the air so cold that he could not sleep.\n\nThere, he said, the sounds of torture were much clearer.\n\n\"One time I heard a man screaming from morning until evening,\" he says.\n\nA few days later, the prisoners were loaded onto minibuses and sent away to an unknown location. Mr Ghappar, who was suffering from a cold and with his nose running, was separated from the rest and taken to the facility seen in the video he sent - a place he described as an \"epidemic control centre\". Once there, he was handcuffed to the bed.\n\n\"My whole body is covered in lice. Every day I catch them and pick them off from my body - it's so itchy,\" he writes.\n\n\"Of course, the environment here is better than the police station with all those people. Here I live alone, but there are two people guarding me.\"\n\nIt was the slightly more relaxed regime that gave him, he says, the opportunity he needed to get word out. His phone appears to have remained unnoticed by the authorities among his personal belongings, some of which he was given access to in his new place of imprisonment.\n\nAfter 18 days inside the police jail, he was suddenly and secretly in touch with the outside world.\n\nFor a few days he described his experiences. Then, suddenly, the messages stopped.\n\nNothing has been heard from Mr Ghappar since. The authorities have provided no formal notification of his whereabouts, nor any reason for his continued detention.\n\nIt is impossible to independently verify the authenticity of the text messages. But experts say that the video footage appears to be genuine, in particular because of the propaganda messages that can be heard in the background.\n\n\"Xinjiang has never been an 'East Turkistan'\", says an announcement in both Uighur and Chinese from a loudspeaker outside his window.\n\n\"Separatist forces at home and abroad have politicised this geographical term and called for those who speak Turkic languages and believe in Islam to unite,\" the announcement says.\n\nJames Millward, a professor of history at Georgetown University and an expert on China's policies in Xinjiang, translated and analysed Mr Ghappar's text messages for the BBC.\n\nHe says they are consistent with other well documented cases, from his transportation back to Xinjiang and the initial processing in crowded, unsanitary conditions.\n\n\"This firsthand description of the police holding cell is very, very vivid,\" Professor Millward says.\n\n\"He writes in very good Chinese and gives, frankly, a lot of horrific detail about the way these people are treated. So, it's quite a rare source.\"\n\nDr Adrian Zenz, a senior fellow in China studies at the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation, and another leading Xinjiang scholar, suggests that the video's real value is what it says about the Chinese government claim that the camp system is being wound down.\n\n\"It is extremely significant,\" Dr Zenz says. \"This testimony shows that the whole system of detaining people, sorting them and then feeding them into extra judicial internment\u2026 that this is very much ongoing.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption China's ambassador: \"There is no such concentration camp in Xinjiang\"\n\nAnother layer of credibility is provided by a photograph of a document that sources say Mr Ghappar sent after finding it on the floor of one of the epidemic control centre toilets.\n\nThe document refers to a speech made by the Communist Party Secretary of Aksu Prefecture, and the date and location suggest it could well have still been circulating in official circles in the city of Kucha around the time of Mr Ghappar's detention.\n\nThe document's call for children as young as 13 to be encouraged to \"repent for their mistakes and voluntarily surrender\" appears to be new evidence of the extent of China's monitoring and control of the thoughts and behaviours of the Uighurs and other minorities.\n\n\"I think this is the first time I've seen an official notice of minors being held responsible for their religious activity,\" says Dr Darren Byler, an anthropologist at the University of Colorado, Boulder who has researched and written extensively about the Uighurs.\n\nDespite the risk that the publication of Merdan Ghappar's video and text messages will put him at risk of longer or harsher punishment, those close to him say they no longer have any choice.\n\n\"Staying silent will not help him either,\" says his uncle, Abdulhakim Ghappar, from his home in Amsterdam.\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption Demonstrators in Paris hold signs calling for an end to the Uighur \"genocide\"\n\nAbdulhakim says he kept in regular touch with his nephew before he was taken into detention, and he believes - as has been well documented in other cases - that this overseas connection is one of the reasons Mr Ghappar was detained.\n\n\"Yes, I am 100% sure about it,\" he said. \"He was detained just because I am abroad and I take part in protests against Chinese human rights abuses.\"\n\nAbdulhakim's activism, which began in 2009 in Xinjiang when he helped hand out flyers ahead of a large-scale protest in the city of Urumqi, was the reason he fled to the Netherlands in the first place.\n\nThe protest in Urumqi later spilled into a series of violent riots which, Chinese authorities say, claimed nearly 200 lives and are seen as another one of the major turning points towards its tightening control over the region.\n\nTold that the Chinese authorities were seeking his arrest, Abdulhakim got himself a passport and left. He has never been back.\n\nHe insists that all of his political activities, both inside China and abroad, have been peaceful, and his nephew, he says, has never shown any interest in politics at all.\n\nThe list of questions sent by the BBC to the Chinese authorities asked them to confirm whether Merdan Ghappar or his uncle are suspected of any crime in China.\n\nIt also asked why Mr Ghappar was shackled to a bed, and for a response from the authorities to his other allegations of mistreatment and torture.\n\nNone of the questions was answered.\n\nWherever Merdan Ghappar is now, one thing is clear.\n\nWhether his earlier conviction for a drugs offence was just or not, his current detention is proof that even well-educated and relatively successful Uighurs can become a target of the internment system.\n\n\"This young man, as a fashion model, has a successful career already,\" said Professor Millward. \"He speaks wonderful Chinese, writes very well and uses fancy phrases, so clearly this is not someone who needs education for a vocational purpose.\"\n\nDr Adrian Zenz argues that this is the point of the system.\n\n\"It doesn't actually matter so much what the background of the person is,\" he says.\n\n\"What matters is that their loyalty has been tested by the system. At some point almost everybody is going to experience some form of internment or re-education, everybody is going to be subjected to this system.\"\n\nThe Chinese government denies that it is persecuting the Uighur population. After heavy criticism over the issue recently from the US, a spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry, Hua Chunying, invoked the death of George Floyd, saying that Uighurs in Xinjiang were free in comparison to African Americans in the US.\n\nBut for Merdan Ghappar's family, haunted by the image of him chained to a bed in an unknown location, there is a connection between the two cases.\n\n\"When I saw the George Floyd video it reminded me of my nephew's own video,\" says Merdan's uncle Abdulhakim.\n\n\"The entire Uighur people are just like George Floyd now,\" he says. \"We can't breathe.\"\n\nMore coverage of China's hidden camps"}, {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-53656462", "published": "2020-08-04T23:04:34", "title": "Microsoft's TikTok grab: Inspired or naive?", "text": "Image copyright EPA/Getty Images Image caption Buying TikTok could pose risks for Satya Nadella's Microsoft\n\nLast week, Congress grilled Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook.\n\nMicrosoft, wasn't invited to the party.\n\nI thought Microsoft's boss would be relieved that his company was safely out of the firing line.\n\nIt appears I was wrong.\n\nWhat I didn't know at the time was that Satya Nadella was in fact looking to expand deeper into social media.\n\nMicrosoft already owns LinkedIn. Acquiring video-based social-media platform TikTok, though, would make it responsible for its controversial content.\n\nIn short, it would open itself up to all the criticisms and accusations that the other big social-media companies have faced in recent years.\n\nTikTok doesn't allow political ads. It wants to encourage fun, creative, sharable content. But TikTok - almost unwittingly - has become political.\n\nFor example, videos using the #BLM hashtag - referencing Black Lives Matter - have been viewed more than 12 billion times; videos using the #Trump2020 hashtag more than seven billion.\n\nConspiracy theories\n\nThere's plenty of controversial stuff on the platform, too, from conspiracy theories to hateful content.\n\nIf Microsoft buys TikTok, make no mistake, it is buying a platform with a lot of politics on it.\n\nAnd that matters. Facebook, which owns Instagram; Google, which owns YouTube, and Twitter have learnt the hard way that trying to moderate political content can be a nightmare.\n\nWhat do you do when Donald Trump calls into question postal voting? Or someone sticks up a video recommending hydroxychloroquine? Or a user denies climate change? These are the headaches that these companies have to deal with every day.\n\nEven though the Congressional hearing last week was about antitrust, many of the questions were to do with political interference on the companies' social-media platforms.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images/EPA/Reuters Image caption Jeff Bezos, Tim Cook, Mark Zuckerberg and Sundar Pichai faced a Congressional grilling\n\nThese are headaches that Microsoft is currently free from. Why, then, would a company actively court them?\n\nNadella, it seems, can't resist a bargain\n\nHe thinks he can buy the American arm of TikTok, which would also include TikTok in Canada, Australia and New Zealand, at a basement price.\n\nAfter all, Trump says he will ban TikTok if the company can't find a suitor by 15 September. That puts Microsoft in a commanding negotiating position.\n\nMicrosoft's technological proficiency also means it's likely US Republicans would trust the company to safeguard users' data from Beijing's cyber-spies.\n\nAnd because ad spend on LinkedIn is a fraction of what Facebook or YouTube rake in, it's unlikely the purchase will get caught in anti-competition legislation.\n\nMajor China presence\n\nIf I were drawing a cartoon of Nadella right now, he'd have dollar signs for eyes.\n\nAnd yet, there are still potential pitfalls.\n\nThe China Daily - a state-owned newspaper - described TikTok's treatment as \"theft\" and said China \"had plenty of ways to respond if the administration carries out its planned smash-and-grab\".\n\nThat is a problem for Microsoft because unlike some US tech giants, it has a major presence in China.\n\nIn fact, Microsoft brags on its website that: \"Today, our most complete subsidiary and largest R&D centre outside the United States is in China .\"\n\nTo put it bluntly, if Microsoft is seen by Beijing as having cashed in on TikTok, China has the levers it can pull to hurt it.\n\nThat would be a spectacular own goal for Microsoft - in a market that Bill Gates first got the company into in 1992.\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption President Trump has said TikTok will be banned unless it is sold\n\nAnd it gets worse.\n\nWhite House trade adviser Peter Navarro was asked on Monday by CNN whether Microsoft was going to be compromised by the deal.\n\n\"Maybe Microsoft could divest its Chinese holdings,\" he said.\n\nThat really plays to the heart of what is happening here. Trump's administration doesn't much like Chinese tech in the US, and it doesn't much like big US tech companies getting too close to Beijing, either.\n\nThis, then, is a perfect opportunity for the president. Remember that the deal is totally dependent on Trump's patronage.\n\nNadella has said that he's only exploring the possibility of a purchase after he got the green light from President Trump.\n\nGeopolitical baggage\n\nTrump has already said that the US taxpayer should get a cut of any deal. But what else does Trump want? That will worry Microsoft.\n\nIn fact, the more you think about it, the more it's the case that Microsoft, by acquiring TikTok, would be acquiring its geopolitical baggage, too.\n\nAs big as Microsoft is, it's still small enough to be a pawn in a game of chess between two global superpowers.\n\nThe question now: is that a risk Nadella is willing to take?

But any sympathy the wider public may have had towards such movements evaporated after the horrific Oklahoma City attack.\n\nNow there are signs that their ideas are catching on again.\n\nThe political climate is to blame, including emergency coronavirus measures and anti-police sentiment after the killing of George Floyd.\n\nAlong with groups like the Boogaloo Boys, Three Percenters, and the Proud Boys, sovereign citizens are one of the fringe, and often overlapping, blocs who've popped up on social media and on the streets.\n\nTheir ideas travel.\n\nWhen I covered an anti-lockdown protest in London in May, the first person I encountered was a man eager to tell me why the government had no legal power over him.\n\nBut it's the US where the greatest potential for violence lies - particularly as Americans get deeper into a pandemic and a potentially fraught election campaign.\n\nIn Singapore, a country known for adherence to rules, a viral video in May this year showed a 40-year-old woman refusing to don a face mask, telling people \"I'm a sovereign\u2026 This is something people are not going to know what it is\".\n\n\"It means I have nothing to do with the police, it means I have no contract with the police. They have no say over me,\" said the woman, who was later sent to a mental health facility.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption An officer enforcing Melbourne's lockdown had her head smashed into the ground by a 'sovereign citizen'\n\nIn the US, suspects of violent crimes - including a man accused of beheading his landlord in a rent dispute last week - have claimed to be immune from prosecution as sovereign citizens.\n\nOne of the ideology's most famous adopters was Oklahoma City bombing conspirator Terry Nichols, who filed endless frivolous lawsuits against the government in the years before the 1995 attack on a federal office building which killed 168 people.\n\nThe sovereign citizen movement is different from the militia movement, which puts more emphasis on paramilitary weapons training and organisation, experts say.\n\nSovereign citizens - which also go by many other names including constitutionalists, common law citizens, freemen, and non-resident aliens - favour legal arguments.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption QAnon is a bizarre conspiracy cult that has surged in popularity during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nIt also differs from the QAnon conspiracy theory which believes President Donald Trump is saving the world from evil, because sovereign citizens view all government figures, including Mr Trump, as illegitimate.\n\nWhat do sovereign citizens believe?\n\nThere are a multitude of theories that followers believe, experts say, cautioning that it is hard to determine the number of believers worldwide due to a lack of structure.\n\nThe general ideology is based on the belief that the original government set up by the US founders, which most adherents refer to as \"common law\", was slowly and secretly replaced by an illegitimate government sometime in the 1800s.\n\nFollowers around the world make similar claims about their own governments - or the British Royal Family as is the case with Australia, says Mr Pitcavage.\n\nThey believe there is a legal way to opt out of the current legal system that comes through filing documents and ending what they view as \"contracts\" with the government, such as driving licences and other identity documents.\n\nAdherents are told by \"redemption gurus\" that they can use phrases, which they believe to have legal meaning, to \"divorce themselves\" from the illegitimate government, says Mr Pitcavage. They often print out and carry documents which they claim prove their status.\n\n\"And once you do that, once you have regained your sovereignty, none of the laws, rules, taxes, court orders, anything of the illegitimate de facto government have any more power or justification over you whatsoever.\"\n\nFollowers resist all government laws and regulations, no matter how trivial, and in the US often file lengthy legal battles against the government, which critics refer to as \"paper terrorism\". They sometimes film encounters with police using the phrases that they believe protect them, including \"am I being detained?\"\n\nThey have occasionally set up \"common law courts\" and issued bogus arrest warrants for US officials. Some have been arrested with fake car registration plates they have issued to themselves, or have even printed their own currency believing the dollar to be invalid. Mr Pitcavage says it's common to find European followers cite the US criminal code, which has no legal bearing there.\n\nSome followers believe it possible to access a secret government-held fund once they become sovereign. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS), which oversees federal tax payments in the US, says on its website that the notion of \"secret accounts assigned to each citizen is pure fantasy\".\n\nSome think that \"by filing a series of complex, legal-sounding documents, the sovereign can tap into that secret Treasury account for his own purposes,\" according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks extremist groups.\n\nFollowers are often struggling financially or are people who cannot tolerate government bureaucracy, says Mr Pitcavage.\n\n\"The sovereign citizen movement, through its pseudo-legal theories and tactics, tells them who to blame - it's the illegitimate government, it's the illegitimate banking system, it's this and that. And then offers them ways out.\""}, {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-53640724", "published": "2020-08-05T08:33:29", "title": "TikTok: The story of a social media giant", "text": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nPresident Donald Trump has warned that he will ban TikTok unless an American firm buys its US operations. So how did an app attract millions of users but come to be seen as a national security risk in just two years?\n\nAlone it stands, a red gummy bear atop a dimly lit stage, and the unmistakable voice of Adele singing. Then, as the unseen crowd joins in with the next line, the camera pans out to reveal hundreds more gummy bears singing along to Someone Like You.\n\nIt's silly and cute and extremely watchable. And for the fledgling video app TikTok, it did more in 15 seconds than marketing budgets of millions.\n\nPosted in December 2018, it quickly racked up millions of views on the app but - more importantly - was picked up by thousands of copycats on other social networks.\n\nThe world was alerted to the app and TikTok has since attracted a vibrant, creative and young audience of hundreds of millions.\n\nImage copyright TikTok/@davidkasprak Image caption The Adele video sparked a trend on social media\n\nTikTok's origins are different to the fairytale start-up story we have heard before. This is not an empire built by a couple of friends with a great idea in their mum's garage.\n\nIt actually started life as three different apps.\n\nThe first was an app called Musical.ly, which launched in Shanghai in 2014 but had strong US business links and a healthy audience in that key market.\n\nIn 2016, Chinese tech giant ByteDance launched a similar service in China called Douyin. It attracted 100 million users in China and Thailand in the space of a year.\n\nByteDance decided it was onto something and wanted to expand under a different brand - TikTok. So, in 2018 it bought Musical.ly, folded it in, and began TikTok's global expansion.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption WATCH: What's going on with TikTok?\n\nTikTok's secret lies in its use of music and an extraordinarily powerful algorithm, which learns what content users like to see far faster than many other apps.\n\nUsers can choose from a huge database of songs, filters and movie clips to lipsync to.\n\nIt's inspired some huge trends like Lil Nas X's Old Town Road or Curtis Roach's Bored in the House. Even the BBC News theme tune went viral as Brits made light of daily coronavirus briefings.\n\nMany people will spend most of the time on the For You Page. This is where the algorithm puts content in front of users, anticipating what they will enjoy based on content they have already engaged with.\n\nIt's also where it shows content it thinks could go viral. The idea is that if the content is good it will travel, regardless of how many followers the creator has.\n\nMany TikTok communities have emerged, brought together by the types of content they enjoy or their sense of identity.\n\nCommunities like \"Alt\" or \"Deep\" often feature creators who aren't necessarily looking to fill their wallets but who are simply on the platform to make funny or informative content. For them, it's not about winning the attention of big brands - it's about finding like-minded people.\n\nThe growth of TikTok and its sister app Douyin have been rapid.\n\nIn July last year the apps already had one billion downloads worldwide, of which 500 million were active users. A year later they were on two billion downloads and about 800 million active users.\n\nThe app's rapid growth has also put TikTok at the forefront of the minds of politicians. What does it mean to have a Chinese app so quickly become a large part of modern life?\n\nAlthough the accusations are vague, India and the US have concerns that TikTok is collecting sensitive data from users that could be used by the Chinese government for spying. It has been alleged that every major Chinese enterprise has an internal \"cell\" answerable to the ruling Chinese Communist Party, with many of its agents tasked with gathering secrets.\n\nIndia initially banned TikTok in April 2019, after a court ordered its removal from app stores amid claims it was being used to spread pornography. That decision was overturned on appeal.\n\nWhen it banned TikTok again, along with dozens of other Chinese owned apps in June 2020, the Indian government said it had received complaints about apps \"stealing and surreptitiously transmitting users' data\".\n\nThe US government opened a national security review of the platform in late 2019, after both a Democrat and a Republican lawmaker suggested it posed a risk.\n\nMore recently, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo claimed TikTok was among a number of Chinese apps \"feeding data directly to the Chinese Communist Party\".\n\nThe UK's Information Commissioner's Office and Australian intelligence agencies are currently probing the app but haven't revealed what they are looking for.\n\nIt's of course worth noting that relations between these countries are tense, with the US at odds with China over trade, Indian and Chinese forces involved in border clashes, and the UK opposing new security laws in Hong Kong.\n\nExactly what TikTok does with data is contested.\n\nWe know from its privacy policy that it collects a huge amount, including:\n\nWhich videos are watched and commented on\n\nLocation data\n\nPhone model and operating system\n\nKeystroke rhythms when people type\n\nIt was also revealed that it read the copy-and-paste clipboards of users, but so did dozens of other apps including Reddit, LinkedIn and the BBC News app, and nothing sinister was discovered.\n\nMost evidence points to TikTok's data collection being comparable to other data-hungry social networks such as Facebook.\n\nHowever, unlike its US-based rivals, TikTok says it is willing to offer an unprecendented level of transparency in order to ease some of the fears about its data collection and flow.\n\nTikTok's new chief executive Kevin Mayer, an American former Disney executive, said it would allow experts to examine the code behind its algorithms. This is hugely significant in an industry where data and code is closely guarded.\n\nHowever, the concerns aren't just about what data is collected, it's also more theoretical - could the Chinese government compel ByteDance to hand over data?\n\nThe same concerns have been raised about Huawei.\n\nThe 2017 National Security Law in China compels any organisation or citizen to \"support, assist and co-operate with the state intelligence work\".\n\nHowever, like Chinese telecoms giant Huawei, bosses at TikTok have repeatedly said that if this ever happened, \"we would definitely say no to any request for data\".\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming is China's 10th richest person, according to the Forbes Rich List\n\nAnother concern is of the possibility of censorship, or of the app being used to influence public debates.\n\nTikTok is one of the first platforms many young people will come to to share social activism content.\n\nIn May it promoted #BlackLivesMatter as a trend. But even as the hashtag drew in billions of views, there were criticisms that content from black creators was being supressed and that hashtags related to the protests were being hidden.\n\nIt is not the first time TikTok's algorithm has been criticised for the way content is chosen.\n\nA report by The Intercept suggested that moderators had been encouraged to deprioritise content from anyone deemed too \"ugly\", or poor.\n\nLast year, the Guardian reported that TikTok censored material deemed to be politically sensitive, including footage of Tiananmen Square protests and Tibetan independence demands.\n\nFurther reporting from the Washington Post suggested moderators in China had the final say on whether videos were approved.\n\nByteDance said such guidelines had since been phased out and that all moderation was independent of Beijing.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Will TikTok be banned?\n\nYet the discussions taking place with Microsoft about the possibility of buying TikTok's US operations show it is one of the most significant technology products in years.\n\nTikTok has emerged as a meeting place for under-25s, whereas apps like Twitter and Instagram are often seen as being for older users.\n\nBut for those who use TikTok to have their voices heard, the possibility of a ban feels like a loss.\n\nDownloads of shortform video app competitors Byte and Triller have spiked in the US as users prepare themselves for jumping ship.\n\nBut many, it seems, will hang on to TikTok until the very last moment - if that moment comes."}, {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-53531797", "published": "2020-08-04T23:30:47", "title": "My Money: 'I eat biscuits like a naughty schoolboy'", "text": "Image copyright Mark Bauwens\n\nMy Money is a series looking at how people spend their money - and the sometimes tough decisions they have to make.

Since starting, I've gone from over 85kg down to just under 70kg to maximise my chances in the unlikely event I catch the virus, as all the government, medical and scientific advice as well as BBC News coverage indicates that being lean, active and fit is critical to survival and best recovery.\n\nImage copyright Mark Bauwens\n\nEach morning is spent riding, looking after the horses and afternoons looking after the fields in which the horses live in summer. Manure for the fruits and vegetables I grow is not in short supply! I wish it was possible to barter manure for bread, tractor diesel and car petrol.\n\nA car-free life is totally impractical as although the supermarket is within riding distance a modern town is too dangerous for a horse and rider. In a rural world, electric cars are impractical due to long distances, the paucity of charging points and their lack of range. Country people drive in fields and tow heavy trailers which will never be compatible with electric cars. It's why economic diesel 4x4s proliferate.\n\nImage copyright Mark Bauwens\n\nI suppose, in years to come, if things really become much worse, people might revert to a horse and cart in towns.

But one of the advantages of an iPhone diary is that entries are so easy to delete.

The septic tank is sensitive to disinfectant and bleach which will kill that chemical process so I have good reason.\n\nNo invitation tonight to friends, so I'll barbecue the steak treat.

One year later, many of them have been charged with serious offences and are still languishing in jails across India. BBC Hindi's Majid Jahangir reports.\n\nTasleema Wani and her family were fast asleep on the night of 6 August when there was a loud banging on the door.\n\nIt was the day after the Indian government in Delhi stunned the country by revoking a constitutional provision that gave Jammu and Kashmir special powers. The decision split the part of the disputed region that India administers into two federal territories, and saw an unprecedented curfew and communications lockdown imposed.\n\n\"It was a team of joint security forces from the army and police and they were screaming for us to open the door. It was terrifying,\" Ms Wani said.\n\n\"They sent me inside, and took both my sons outside to the lawn and questioned them for about 15 minutes. Then they left.\"\n\nBut they later came back and asked her elder son, 19-year-old Nadeem, to show them the way to a neighbour's house. That was the last time Ms Wani saw him.\n\nHe was taken to a police station, detained and eventually transferred to a jail in Uttar Pradesh state, more than 1,000km (620 miles) away.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The families of two detained men have spoken to the BBC\n\nIn an official dossier, which the BBC has seen, police have accused Nadeem Wani of being an \"Over Ground Worker\". Such \"OGWs\" are defined by security forces as non-combatant members of armed rebel groups, usually tasked with logistics.\n\nHe has also been charged with other offences, including putting up posters asking people not to participate in the 2014 elections - he was 15 at the time.\n\n\"I know my son. He is not a militant and never took part in any unlawful activity. I appeal to the government to please release him,\" Ms Wani pleaded. Her husband, Mohammad Ashraf Wani, has only seen Nadeem once in the entire year that he has been in jail.\n\nNadeem is among thousands of Kashmiris who were detained in a massive security operation that began in the region just before 5 August and continued for weeks after. Politicians, businesspeople, lawyers, activists and others with alleged links to protests or militant groups were detained, imprisoned or placed under house arrest. Three former chief ministers were among those who were detained - one of them is still under house arrest.\n\nDespite strident criticism in India and abroad, the government insisted that the arrests were necessary to maintain law and order in the region, which has seen increased militancy in recent years.\n\nImage caption Thousands of Kashmiris have been detained and sent to jails across the country\n\nMany, including Nadeem, have been detained under the controversial Public Safety Act (PSA), which among other things, allows detention without formal charge for up to two years.\n\nIt's unclear exactly how many Kashmiris have been detained or jailed as part of this crackdown. On 20 November 2019, the government told parliament that they had made 5,161 preventive arrests since 4 August that year. But it's unclear how many of them have been charged under the PSA and how many are still in jail.\n\nCourt records obtained by a civil organisation made up of parents of \"disappeared\" Kashmiris show that as many as 662 petitions challenging detentions under the PSA were registered in 2019. The majority of those, 412, were filed after 5 August.\n\nThe BBC asked Kashmir Inspector General of Police (IGP) Vijay Kumar for information on the arrests but he said he could not share \"such sensitive data\".\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Kashmir has ling seen protests against Indian rule\n\nRights activists have alleged that these arrests and detentions are aimed at creating fear.\n\n\"The arrests were to silence the people.

The state didn't want to hear reactionary voices,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, those who have been released have spoken of the ordeal of detention.\n\nQamar Zaman Qazi, editor of regional online news portal The Kashmiryat, was detained days after being summoned to \"explain\" some tweets.\n\nImage copyright Mukhtar Zohoor Image caption Mr Qazi wore the same shirt throughout his time in jail\n\nIn the days before 5 August, the region had seen a massive military build-up. Until then the government had given no indication of what was to come, and the entire operation had been kept a closely-guarded secret.\n\nMr Qazi's tweets on 26 July - talking about additional troop movements - were noticed by local police who summoned him to the station the next day and detained him. On 8 August, he was transferred to the central jail in Srinagar, the capital of Indian-administered Kashmir.\n\n\"We were stripped naked there.

According to Statistics Canada, of the roughly 500,000 people between the ages of 15-24 who lost their jobs in April, about half were working full-time.\n\nYoung women and minorities are particularly vulnerable, according to a report by the Brookings Institution.\n\nThe BBC spoke with four young adults who are looking for work - this is what they say it's like to be in your 20s and unemployed during the pandemic.\n\nImage copyright Submitted photo\n\nName: Ross Mortimer\n\nAge: 26\n\nLocation: Toronto, Ontario\n\nPrevious occupation: Opera singer, server\n\nWhat are you doing now? I've started babysitting. I go over in the morning four times a week. I'm trying to keep up with music as well, I had to rent a keyboard so I could practise in the house.\n\nI'm just trying to enjoy the summer. With music there's probably nothing that will make money until January, and I just have to accept that.\n\nHow are you getting by? Before the pandemic, I was making at least twice as much money a month but my income varied. Now I know exactly how much money I'm going to have a month because I receive the government coronavirus stipend, and I can budget. I'm really afraid for September though, when my student loans will start up again (they were paused because of coronavirus).\n\nHow's the job search going? There's no guarantee of any work next year at the Canadian Opera Company (COC). And they cancelled the fall - two out of six shows that season - with the possibility of the whole next season not happening. I'm kind of nervous to go back to restaurants right now because I think I'm not going to be able to find a job until they open inside, and then it's working inside with lots of exposure to people.\n\nWhat are your fears for the future? My main goal is music. So the restaurant, while I'm sad I've lost out of that income stream, I'm not overly concerned. But with music, that industry could be permanently affected. My biggest fear is probably arts organisations shutting down permanently. I just worry that culture in Canada is going to be not supported.\n\nI literally just graduated from my master's a year ago. I was getting jobs - I got the chorus job (at the COC) and I spent last summer in Italy singing. Now I'm doing nothing.\n\nHow does your age affect your situation? There's so much less job security, but because I've basically grown up in that I'm not surprised. I'm used to having to look for odd jobs like babysitting, or going to paint somebody's wall. It doesn't feel totally crazy. I've never had a full time job with benefits available to me.\n\nImage copyright Submitted photo Image caption 'I had to get used to the uncertainty'\n\nName: Zainab Mehdi\n\nAge: 22\n\nLocation: Toronto, Ontario\n\nPrevious occupation: Recent graduate from McGill University with a BA in Psychology\n\nWhat were you planning to do this summer? This summer my plan was to stay in Montreal and research for a bit, because I was working for a behavioural neuroscience lab and we were working on a paper that was supposed to be sent for publishing in the next few months. McGill shut down on 13 March and the labs haven't really opened since.\n\nHow are you getting by? I have been receiving the Canada Emergency Student Benefit (CESB) since May. It is only given for 16 weeks so my final month would be August.\n\nHow have your plans changed? My lease was going to finish so I couldn't really stay in Montreal anymore. My family is in Pakistan so I'm staying with my friend in Toronto in her family home.\n\nI've switched over to look for more jobs in the business sector, under project management or market research. Academic research wasn't really an option, in the subject I was interested in, because it wasn't really essential.\n\nHow is your job search going? I wouldn't say it's going well. The roles I'm looking for are entry level, there aren't many roles available and even when I do apply to applications they usually just say 'thanks for applying, but we're not going to proceed any further'. I've been trying to fill my time with learning some hard skills. I've been taking a course, and I've been interning for a construction company in project management, but it's part time.\n\nHow has it been emotionally? I had to get used to the uncertainty. Any short-term goal or long-term goal just went out the window. So there was a lot of anxiety and stress there. There was a whole new world I didn't even understand that I was going into, and nobody else even understood it. I had to get used to the fact that I shouldn't have expectations anymore.\n\nWhen I did eventually get through that, it became easier. I tried making the most of the small things I was doing and recognising that I am doing a lot. It's not comparable to the pace I was doing before, but I can't really compare because it's not the same world. At the same time that you're dealing with a lot of uncertainty, you're still receiving news about a lot of loss. People are dying, there's so much grief.\n\nImage copyright Submitted Photo Image caption Maxime Barret on the roof of the hotel where he has worked as a stationary engineer for the past five years\n\nName: Maxime Barret\n\nAge: 24\n\nLocation: Washington, DC\n\nPrevious occupation: Stationary engineer, specialising in maintaining and repairing boilers and HVAC equipment, at a large hotel\n\nWhat are you doing now? I'm still currently employed but we got notice that the hotel may close as of 24 August. We were told when this whole thing started, we would be cut down to 32 hours. Then we were told the hotel would be closing down, and there would be a skeleton crew running the hotel. I was fortunate enough to be a part of that skeleton crew. But in June, we were told the hotel is closing and we all had to find new jobs. Now I don't know whether I should be looking for another job or not.\n\nHow was it getting that news? I've been in that job for five years. It's the kind of job everyone puts their heart and soul into. Everyone felt like family there. It just kind of hurts getting a notice saying you don't have a job anymore. When I did trade school, I did an apprenticeship at that hotel. It was a four-year apprenticeship where you went to school at night and you learn on the job. That was really where I cut my teeth and learned the trade, which made it especially hard to leave it.\n\nHow's your job search going? The job market is definitely not great. The hotel chain has a hiring freeze so it's hard finding a job moving from one hotel to the next, which means I lose all my benefits.\n\nI've applied to at least 30 jobs. I've probably had about six interviews, and I haven't heard back from many of them. It's been pretty tough. Before I was trying to apply for something that looked like a better job to go to, but now I'm just looking for whatever I can take. Running out of health insurance in a pandemic is not what you want to do.\n\nI am in a union - the union has really great insurance, but you have to find a job within the same union. But even the union gave is the advice of just take whatever you can get right now.\n\nHow does your age affect your situation? It's good in some ways because in the blue-collar trades there's not a lot of young people. But in another sense, it's hard when you have everyone who's 20 years my senior with a lot more experience than me. Or managers who a lot of times look down on younger years, thinking if you don't have 30 years in the trade you don't know anything.\n\nImage copyright Submitted photo Image caption 'You feel like you're not good enough'\n\nName: Katherine Fiallos\n\nAge: 22\n\nLocation: Montreal, Quebec\n\nPrevious occupation: Recent graduate from McGill University with a BS in Microbiology and Immunology\n\nHow's your job search going? I got an internship in Montreal just before the pandemic hit in global health, but it's just for this summer. For the long-term, I'm mostly looking for jobs in San Francisco, where I'm from, and Canada, where I went to school.\n\nI've applied to about 120-150 jobs online. About seven jobs postings were cancelled, which means they're no longer hiring, and I've gotten two interviews so far. The rest have just not gotten back to me.\n\nSan Francisco is a hub of a lot of jobs and opportunities. You're used to people telling you to \"come to San Francisco, there's all these tech and bio-tech companies\" but going through the job-hunting process at this time, you can really feel the change in the economy.\n\nWhat does that feel like? It's frustrating. Once you start to go through months without hearing responses, you kind of feel like you're just not good enough. Even after all the efforts you've done, like getting internships and going through the four years of gruelling academic work, you just kind of feel like it's a waste. You have to tell yourself that it's not really you, it's part of the process - but it can really get to you.\n\nHow are you getting by? I'm getting by with the money that my parents generously gave me to get through my last year of university and the summer while I do my internship in Montreal. I did get grant money for my summer research project which would be barely enough to pay for my rent and living expenses. Being honest, if my parents wouldn't have helped me out financially, I would probably be more stressed about my finances and about just living in general without a job.\n\nHow has the pandemic changed your goals? The pandemic reminded me of the importance of public health. It was something I had considered briefly, but after the pandemic happened, I realised it's something really important and something I would want to get into.\n\nHow does your age affect your situation? I never looked for a job before a pandemic, so it's hard for me to compare. In a way it is an advantage because young people are more sought out. If you're a young person with a bit of experience then it's probably more of an advantage, as opposed to a young person that has just graduated and needs to be trained, which is something companies are not always willing to do."}, {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/av/cricket/53665196", "published": "2020-08-05T14:00:59", "title": "Big moment?

and it may not be the last.\n\nBut, just as in Austria at the start of the season, this is unlikely to be a Groundhog Day repetition of the first run.\n\nLast weekend's race threw up a number of interesting talking points - so here is a rundown of what to look out for at Silverstone this weekend.\n\nHamilton inspects his front-left tyre after victory on Sunday\n\nWill the tyres run into trouble again?\n\nMany people's eyes start to close when you discuss tyres, but they were ultimately the deciding factor in the race last weekend, producing an all-time great finish and a moment that could even end up deciding the championship.\n\nThe front left tyre on Valtteri Bottas' Mercedes blew with two laps to go, leaving him scoring no points, while team-mate Lewis Hamilton's tyre failed on the final lap in time for him to crawl to victory and take a large 30-point lead over the Finn in the standings.\n\nBut with Carlos Sainz suffering exactly the same failure in his McLaren and Daniil Kvyat suffering a right-rear failure in his Alpha Tauri much earlier in the race, there will be a lot of question marks over the tyres and plenty of strategy work to be done on the pit walls.\n\nIt was Kvyat's failure at Maggotts on lap 12 that created the issues for the others later on.\n\nKvyat's sudden deflation pitched him into the wall at a phenomenal speed, bringing out the safety car, and making everyone jump into the pit lane for hard tyres, which they intended to take to the end.\n\nThis was always going to be on the limit of possibility, because the left-front tyre takes a particular hammering around Silverstone's extremely fast circuit, featuring predominantly right-hand bends.\n\nGiven a free choice, the teams would not have pitted so early, but the allure of an effectively free pit stop under the safety car was too much, and few could have foreseen what unfolded at the end, even with the marginal tyre life.\n\nA lot of focus will be placed on practice long runs and tyre choices before this weekend's grand prix, but any thoughts that it will be easier second time around are misguided.\n\nPirelli are actually supplying softer tyres this weekend in an effort to spice up the action. And that, combined with scorching temperatures forecasted, should give the teams even more headaches.\n\nI expect more caution in terms of pit stops and running cars towards the end of the expected tyre life.\n\nBut the high loads of Silverstone are sure to still cause concern, even with Pirelli increasing the minimum tyre pressures this weekend as a reaction - which sacrifices optimal grip for increased structural integrity of the tyre.\n\nAll in all, last weekend's race proved it ain't over 'til it's over.\n\nBottas has been Hamilton's team-mate since 2017\n\nBottas issues\n\nBottas haemorrhaged points to Hamilton in the championship and, with such a large gap so early in the season against such a formidable rival, the Finn must hit back this weekend to get the gap back below 25 points - or one race victory's worth.\n\nBottas' race pace was good, but he needs to find his qualifying form from 2019, when he out-qualified Hamilton to take pole position in front of a packed Silverstone.\n\nLast weekend, Bottas was overly cautious in battle. Despite getting a better start than Hamilton and getting alongside on the inside, he backed out massively through Turn One and gave his rival an easy run into the first big braking zone at Turn Three.\n\nAside from that, Bottas failed to put Hamilton under any pressure through two safety-car restarts either and, while his pace is OK, it's difficult to see how he will pass the Briton on track if he remains afraid to get his elbows out.\n\nBottas' speed is sufficient to keep him ahead of Hamilton if he can get there - he showed that in the Austrian Grand Prix - but getting there right now is the harder bit.\n\nBottas needs to take more inspiration from his predecessor at Mercedes, Nico Rosberg, if he is to launch any credible title challenge to Hamilton. He must throw caution to the wind a lot more.\n\nIn 2016, Rosberg wasn't afraid to crash with Hamilton if it meant keeping him behind - just look at the Spanish and Austrian Grands Prix that year.\n\nIf Hamilton had passed Rosberg back in Spain 2016, he'd have ended the year champion. Instead, he ended the race in the gravel and Rosberg took the crown.\n\nIt's fair to say Rosberg had more than his fair share of luck in 2016 as well, which Bottas hasn't been the recipient of yet this season, but if he's to fight for the title the Finn must get his elbows out an awful lot more and bounce back this weekend.\n\nWhat can happen when you race Nico Rosberg\n\nWhat went wrong with Vettel?\n\nYou might have missed it, but Sebastian Vettel was in the grand prix last weekend.\n\nThe four-time champion had a horrible time, mired in the midfield, passed by Pierre Gasly's Alpha Tauri in the race, and just about held on to a solitary point, while his Ferrari team-mate Charles Leclerc sprayed the champagne on the podium.\n\nVettel qualified almost a full second off Leclerc and after the race hinted that something might have been wrong with his car.\n\nNobody likes to hear a driver blame the car after a dismal display, but I have a feeling Vettel might be onto something with this after last weekend.\n\nHis car was unreliable throughout the practice sessions and when he was running he never looked like showing any pace. He might not be the preferred option at Ferrari right now, given they are letting him go at the end of the season, but he shouldn't be as far off his team-mate as he was last weekend.\n\nVettel out-qualified Leclerc in the previous two races in Styria and Hungary, and it will be interesting to see if Ferrari have managed to find anything amiss in the head-scratching debrief they'll have had since Sunday.\n\nSlowly but surely, Ferrari are on an upturn of form, and if Vettel can get back to normality it will give them a much better chance to secure their place as the top midfielders.\n\nAlbon crashed during practice at Silverstone last weekend\n\nAlbon needs a trouble-free weekend\n\nRed Bull's Alexander Albon is a man under pressure right now and his crash in Friday practice last weekend seemed to happen at just the wrong moment, just when he looked to be finding some pace.\n\nThat crash, coupled with a reliability issue in Saturday's final practice, left the London-born Thai back in the midfield.\n\nFrom there he had an incident with Haas driver Kevin Magnussen on the first lap - for which I believe it was wrong for the stewards to give him a penalty - and ended up at the back.\n\nHis recovery drive thereafter was solid and earned him a few good points, but I'm hoping we can see a full Albon weekend without any extenuating circumstances this time around, and perhaps for him to start to push team-mate Max Verstappen on back-to-back weekends at a circuit he must know very well.\n\nThis time Hulkenberg might actually get to race\n\nThe hectic midfield battle\n\nAs always, there was some cracking action in the midfield at Silverstone, particularly from both McLarens, Renault's Daniel Ricciardo and Gasly.\n\nThis battle between the Renaults, McLarens, Racing Points and maybe even an Alpha Tauri is always a fascinating, tightly fought scrap, and I fully expect that to be the case once more.\n\nRenault finally showed a proper turn of speed after introducing some upgrades last weekend, edging that midfield bunch, with Ricciardo narrowly missing out on a podium. So having another race at a track that seems to suit their car is good news for them.\n\nBut there will be a lot of attention on Racing Point again.\n\nWill Sergio Perez drive after contracting Covid-19 before last weekend?

There are separate plans for Wales, Northern Ireland and also Scotland, where schools are scheduled to return next Tuesday.\n\nWho will be expected to go back?\n\nNearly all children of legal school age will be expected to return to class full-time in September (August in Scotland).\n\nThis includes those with special educational needs and disabilities, and those who have been shielding.\n\nInitially, schools were told to adopt a ''bubble'' approach, with children split into smaller, fixed groups that would go in on rotation.\n\nBut guidance now suggests all pupils should attend school full-time.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nDo I have to send my child back?\n\nAttendance will be mandatory again from the beginning of the autumn term.\n\nHead teachers will be told to follow up pupils' absence and issue sanctions, including fines in some cases.\n\nPupils must self-isolate and not attend school if they - or a close contact - develop symptoms or test positive for coronavirus.\n\nShielding has now been paused, but there may be occasions when some children are advised to shield for longer because of higher rates of coronavirus in their local area.\n\nChildren who remain under the care of a specialist health professional should discuss their ongoing care before September.\n\nCould schools close again?\n\nA whole school closure \"will not generally be necessary\" unless advised by health officials.\n\nIf a school has a suspected coronavirus outbreak, teachers will liaise with local health teams.\n\nA mobile testing unit may arrive - focusing first on those in the affected child or teacher's class, followed by their year group, and then the whole school if necessary.\n\nIf pupils can't come in, schools are expected to have a home-working plan ready to go.\n\nIs there a link between opening schools and closing pubs?\n\nRising coronavirus infections suggest England is \"near the limit\" of opening up, the Chief Medical Officer has warned, meaning we may need to make trade-offs to ensure children can safely return to school in September.\n\nElements of lockdown easing have already been delayed, and some scientists advising the government have suggested pubs or other activities may need to temporarily close again.\n\nProf Graham Medley told the BBC that reopening schools would ''reconnect lots of households', so closing other networks may be required, and that was ''a matter of prioritising''.

Pubs and restaurants will be closed, and people are being told not to travel to the city, while residents should not travel more than five miles for leisure purposes.\n\nResidents there and in other locked-down areas are not allowed to socialise with other households in their homes, gardens or any other indoor venue, either inside or outside the local area. Travelling for work or education is allowed, but other travel is not advised.\n\nA list of 20 licensed venues involved in the outbreak will be published later on Wednesday.\n\nLocal lockdown rules vary from place to place.\n\nIn the parts of England under lockdown, people can still visit pubs, restaurants and other hospitality venues, but only with members of their household.\n\nThey can also meet up to six people from different households in an outdoor public place.\n\nThe government is passing new laws to enforce these rules, and police will be able to ask people to disperse, and to issue fines.\n\nIn Blackburn with Darwen, indoor gyms, swimming pools and other sports facilities must remain closed.\n\nWhile shielding has now been paused in most parts of England, those shielding in local lockdown areas should continue to do so. Shielding in Charnwood and Blaby in Leicestershire, and also in Luton in Bedfordshire will continue until 17 August, while shielding guidance in the other affected areas will be under review.\n\nWhat has Leicester's local lockdown involved?\n\nLeicester was the first place in the UK to experience local lockdown, after a sharp rise in infections at the beginning of July.\n\nLockdown measures included:\n\nClosure of non-essential shops\n\nNo reopening of bars, restaurants and hairdressers\n\nClosure of schools except for the children of key workers\n\nA limit of up to six people meeting outdoors, with strict social distancing\n\nNo relaxation of shielding measures\n\nResidents were told to stay at home as much as they were able and avoid non-essential travel to, from, and within Leicester.\n\nPeople or businesses that repeatedly flout the new law may be fined up to \u00a33,200.\n\nIn Leicester, most venues can open but leisure centres, gyms and pools will remain closed. Religious ceremonies can also take place.\n\nThe borough of Oadby and Wigston on the city's outskirts have also come out of local lockdown, although there is still a shielding extension there.\n\nWhy have the latest restrictions happened?\n\nThe government is trying to target local clusters or outbreaks to stop the spread as quickly as possible and prevent a national lockdown.\n\nA cluster is a group of cases in one place like a hospital, factory or school. When clusters are linked, this is called an outbreak.\n\nData showing the number of cases in a particular place is used to help decide what action should be taken.\n\nContact tracing data suggests the localised flare-ups were prompted by households meeting up without following social distancing, Health Minister Matt Hancock has suggested.\n\nMore cases are also being identified through testing. England has more than 250 testing centres, and a dozen walk-in centres are being set up.\n\nIf a cluster or outbreak occurs, extra testing equipment, including mobile units, is sent to the area, while door-to-door testing may also take place.\n\nPublic Health England has also produced a watchlist of areas, based on new coronavirus infection rates, and other local intelligence.\n\nImage copyright PA Media Image caption The lockdown in Leicester is still largely in force\n\nWhy are there local lockdowns?\n\nOn 17 July the prime minister announced new powers for local authorities and central government to stop specific outbreaks of Covid-19.\n\nHe said that coronavirus would be controlled \"through targeted local action\", because more was known about how and where it was spreading.\n\nThese actions would range from targeting a hospital, factory, school or one business in a building, to locking down a whole city.\n\nLocal authorities were given powers to:\n\nClose specific premises\n\nShut outdoor spaces\n\nCancel events\n\nMinisters can:\n\nClose sectors or types of premises in local areas\n\nIntroduce localised stay at home orders\n\nReduce the maximum size of gatherings\n\nRestrict the use of transport\n\nStop people leaving a certain area\n\nCan police enforce a lockdown?\n\nPolice have powers to enforce a local lockdown. For example, if they believe that somebody is staying away overnight, they can tell them to return home.\n\nThey can also fine people for breaking the rules, and they may also issue a \"prohibition notice\" directing somebody not to do something.\n\nBut if a resident from a locked-down area wanted to go to a bar in another part of the city, for example, there is nothing legally to stop them.\n\nInstead, the government hopes people's sense of civic responsibility will see them follow guidance to stay at home.\n\nWhat has been said about the rest of the UK?\n\nA local lockdown was considered in Anglesey after an outbreak in June, Public Health Wales says, but it didn't happen.\n\nIn Scotland, public health teams work for the NHS, rather than councils, and the Scottish Government says it is developing a \"responsive system of community surveillance\" at a national, regional and local level to identify outbreaks quickly.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, the government says that any potential clusters or outbreaks will be handled using \"appropriate infection control\" in line with its guidelines for handling any disease outbreak."}, {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-52544307", "published": "2020-07-28T03:20:16", "title": "Coronavirus: What are the UK travel quarantine rules?", "text": "Coronavirus: What are the UK travel quarantine rules?

That is done by antibody tests, which use blood samples.\n\nCan I get tested?\n\nThe lab-based tests are now available to all adults and most children in the UK with a fever, a new continuous cough or a loss of smell or taste.\n\nIn England and Wales you can apply for a swab test for yourself, or for anyone in your household, if you or they have symptoms\n\nIn Northern Ireland and Scotland, anyone over the age of five with symptoms can get tested.\n\nYou can travel to a drive-through testing site, visit a mobile testing unit or get a home testing kit delivered.\n\nThe UK also has capacity for about 80,000 antibody tests a day, but these are only offered to health and care staff.\n\nThey are also used to test random samples of people to estimate the level of exposure across the country.\n\nWhy is testing important?\n\nTesting is essential if the UK's contact-tracing systems are to work effectively to help stop the virus's spread and avoid nationwide lockdowns.\n\nRead more about contact tracing in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\n\nAnd in theory it can help people, including NHS workers, know whether they are safe to go to work.\n\nIt's also useful to monitor the country's level of infection, which can inform NHS and government decisions.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption BBC Reality Check looks at why testing matters\n\nCan people who don't have symptoms be tested?\n\nStaff and residents in care homes should now be receiving regular coronavirus tests whether or not they have symptoms.\n\nSome hospital staff are routinely tested, but there is no national guidance stating they must be.\n\nPeople living in areas where there is a current outbreak can also be tested, even without symptoms.\n\nHow reliable are the tests?\n\nWhen it comes to the most common type of diagnostic test, scientists at the University of Bristol believe 20% of positive cases could falsely appear as negative, wrongly telling someone they are not infected.\n\nThis can be because the swab sample wasn't good enough, the stage of infection someone's at when tested, or problems in the lab.\n\nProf Andrew Beggs, at the University of Birmingham, says the rapid test produced by Oxford Nanopore is as accurate as the lab-based tests. But the results are yet to be published.\n\nCreator of the other rapid test, Prof Chris Toumazou of DNANudge, told the BBC it picked up 98% of positive coronavirus cases.

By Eleanor Lawrie\n\nBBC News Published duration 1 day ago Related Topics Coronavirus pandemic\n\nimage copyright Getty Images\n\nAlmost 10 million workers who are unable to do their job because of the coronavirus outbreak have had their wages paid by the government.\n\nThe furlough scheme was designed to help people who couldn't do their jobs because of the outbreak, and prevent mass redundancies.\n\nFirms now have to pay towards the scheme, which closes in October.\n\nHow is the furlough scheme changing?\n\nUnder the Coronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme, to give furlough its official title, workers placed on leave have been able to receive 80% of their pay, up to a maximum of \u00a32,500 a month.\n\nSince July, these furloughed employees have been able to go back to work part-time.\n\nFor example, an employer could pay someone to work two days a week, while the furlough scheme would cover the other three days not worked.\n\nimage copyright Getty Images image caption Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said employers must start sharing the cost of the scheme from August\n\nSince 1 August, employers have had to pay National Insurance and pension contributions for their staff.\n\nIn September, employers will have to pay 10% of furloughed employees' salaries - rising to 20% in October.\n\nCan I be made redundant while on furlough?\n\nYes. Employees can be made redundant at any point during the scheme, and there are concerns there may be significant job losses when it ends.\n\nTo encourage job retention, the government will pay businesses a \u00a31,000 bonus for every furloughed employee they keep on until the end of January 2021. These workers must be paid an average of at least \u00a3520 a month between November and January.\n\nIf a worker loses their job and is entitled to redundancy pay, this should be calculated based on their pre-furlough wages. New laws have been brought in to enforce this, after a ''minority'' of firms were found to be calculating redundancy pay based on furlough.\n\nFirms can't use the money from furlough to subsidise redundancy packages. If you're made redundant while on furlough because your firm has gone bust, you can apply for payments from the Insolvency Service.\n\nCan I work if I've been furloughed?\n\nWhen the scheme began, furloughed staff weren't able to do any work for their employer. However, they can now be brought back to work on a part-time basis.\n\nThose still on furlough can volunteer in the community or even for their company as long as they aren't creating revenue or providing a service.\n\nimage copyright Getty Images image caption Furloughed workers can volunteer in the community\n\nEmployers can give employees additional training, but must top up furlough payments if they do not reach minimum wage for the period spent doing the training.\n\nIf you work for more than one firm, you can receive furlough from any of them, up to \u00a32,500 a month per employer.\n\nYou can continue working for any that still need you or start working for a new employer, provided you are not breaching any existing contracts.\n\nHow popular has the scheme been?\n\nThe take-up has been significant, with 9.6 million workers furloughed by 1.2 million employers since March.\n\nThese employers had made \u00a333.8bn of furlough claims by 2 August , and the scheme will cost the government an estimated \u00a380bn in total.\n\nThe scheme covers full-time, part-time, flexible, zero-hour and agency workers if they were on their employer's PAYE payroll on 19 March 2020.\n\nWorkers must be furloughed for at least three weeks, and can be furloughed more than once.\n\nimage copyright Getty Images image caption Employers can use an online calculator to work out how much to claim\n\nHow can my business apply?\n\nCompanies can claim 80% of their employees' wages - capped at \u00a32,500 per employee per month before tax, or \u00a3576.92 a week.\n\nEmployers can top up this pay if they wish, and must let workers know they have been furloughed.\n\nIf employees' pay varies each month, companies will need to calculate the claim manually, or seek professional advice.\n\nFurlough covers overtime and commission payments built into an employee's salary, but not discretionary payments such as tips or optional bonuses.\n\nHMRC will check the claim, and pay you through a UK bank within about six working days.\n\nimage copyright Getty Images image caption Apprentices can be furloughed and continue their training\n\nAny UK organisation with employees can apply, but most claims are from private sector businesses and charities.\n\nApprentices can also be furloughed and continue their training. An individual can furlough an employee, such as a nanny, if they are paid through PAYE.\n\nThe self-employed who are adversely affected by the virus are eligible for a taxable grant of up to 80% of their average monthly profit, if they meet certain conditions.\n\nWill I still get sick pay and a bonus?\n\nAnyone on furlough retains the same employment rights. If you are ill you are eligible for statutory sick pay or can be placed on furlough.\n\nIf you are on unpaid leave, shielding or have caring responsibilities, you are also eligible. Staff on parental leave will still receive statutory pay from the government."}, {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/basketball/53556565", "published": "2020-07-31T02:47:28", "title": "NBA: Black Lives Matter and basketball\u2019s role in discussion on racism", "text": "LeBron James has been among the most vocal of those calling for change\n\nWhen fans tuned in as the NBA season resumed at Disney World on Thursday, they were watching a game with a different feel.\n\nOn gleaming courts refashioned from ballrooms, in a basketball 'bubble' protected from coronavirus at the Florida resort, three words were stencilled alongside the enormous NBA logo: 'Black Lives Matter'.\n\nJerseys ordinarily emblazoned with well-known surnames - prized products sold to fans around the world - instead carried activist slogans: 'Justice Now', 'See Us', 'Hear Us', 'Respect Us', 'Love Us'.\n\nThe stands were empty and silent, but one message is already echoing loudly: the NBA wants to talk about racism.\n\nEven before the shocking death of George Floyd triggered a national reckoning, sport had long been a vehicle for protesting against what has been called America's Original Sin.\n\nBig moments - like the raising of a fist by Tommie Smith and John Carlos in a black power salute as the 'Star Spangled Banner' played at the 1968 Olympics - have become iconic images.\n\nMore recent gestures, like those sparked by Colin Kaepernick's refusal to stand for the national anthem, have become a contentious point of political debate in the United States.\n\nRace, as the respected San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich puts it, is the \"elephant in the room in our country\" - one that has come charging into the locker room on many occasions.\n\nOf all sports, basketball is arguably the most obvious place for an unvarnished conversation.\n\nFrom its earliest days of being popularised as entertainment by the Harlem Globetrotters, to a sport still primarily played by black athletes and, in the US, watched largely by ethnic minority fans (two-thirds of those who tuned in during 2016-17 on US TV were non-white), race has figured prominently in the NBA.\n\nThe league says it will embrace the conversation head-on this time. But will it be any different than in the past - and will it make a difference?\n\nBlack players have always been aware of the thin line that separates them from a life of professional success and a far different fate.\n\nAs the youngest of three sons of a single mother growing up in inner city Philadelphia, Rasheed Wallace realised early that it would be hard going, as did everyone around him.\n\n\"The stakes are high, the stakes are real high,\" Wallace - who played for 2004 champions the Detroit Pistons - tells the BBC. Growing up poor and with few opportunities, sports are one of the few ways young black men, especially, can conceive of success.\n\n\"You see a lot of black parents getting on their kids, no matter [whether] it's football, basketball, baseball or any sport. It's like, 'look - this could be our ticket out of here',\" he says.\n\n\"There's a standard you have to live up to. And for us, being black kids in the ghetto, we know that. That if I can make it, I got a chance to make it better for my family.\"\n\nBut that success does not change how the world views a black man when he is out of team uniform, Wallace believes.\n\nStephen Jackson (right) and George Floyd called themselves twins\n\nStephen Jackson was sitting on his living room sofa in late May when his phone began to light up with messages.\n\n\"I opened one from a close friend and it said: 'Do you see what they did to your twin in Minnesota?',\" Jackson, a former San Antonio Spurs shooting guard, tells the BBC. He knew immediately what it meant.\n\nGeorge Floyd had been a close friend for more than 20 years.\n\nFloyd, an imposing Texan of over 6ft 8in who was 46 when he was killed, and Jackson, 42, looked so much alike they called themselves twins.\n\nToday, one has an NBA championship ring and network sports podcast, and the other is dead.\n\n\"That could have been me,\" Jackson says. \"I see myself down there because we look so much alike. I definitely see myself getting murdered in the same fashion by a cop.\"\n\nWallace agrees. \"For sure, it could have been me. Especially with my attitude, the way I am.\"\n\nHe adds: \"Now I think [race] is even more of a bigger burden. It's almost like it's a danger to stand up, to be black. It's a danger for you to be jogging in a neighbourhood. It's almost to the point where black men, we're the targets.\"\n\nFloyd had been a star athlete in his younger days, and was recruited to play basketball for a university team. Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin has been charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter in relation to his death. Three other officers were also charged with aiding and abetting murder. A tentative trial date has been set for March 2021.\n\nWallace, pictured here in 2016, was assistant coach with Detroit from 2013-2014\n\nFor those like Jackson and Wallace, talent has kept misfortune at bay, but it is no guarantee of a happy outcome.\n\nAsked who he would call basketball's greatest of all time, the legendary Kareem Abdul Jabbar did not name Michael Jordan, Wilt Chamberlain or some other household star but Earl Manigault, a street ball player he knew in Harlem, New York as a youth.\n\nManigault is little known, for he never made it into the professional ranks. Seen as a prodigy on street courts, he instead went from an impoverished youth to difficult adulthood, becoming addicted to heroin and serving time for drug possession.\n\n\"For every Michael Jordan, there's an Earl Manigault,\" Manigault once told the New York Times. \"We all can't make it. Somebody has to fail. I was the one.\"\n\nThis is the realisation the rest of the country has been waking up to in 2020 - that the cards are stacked this way in black America. The NBA says it wants to bring it into further focus.\n\nAccording to the league's 2020 handbook, a \"central goal\" of the season will be to use the NBA's platform \"to bring attention and sustained action to issues of social injustice, including combating systemic racism, expanding educational and economic opportunities across the black community, enacting meaningful police and criminal justice reform and promoting greater civic engagement\".\n\nSome, including Jackson, are sceptical. This is not the first time the league has made public statements on racial justice.\n\nIn 2014, the league allowed players to wear T-shirts bearing the words 'I can't breathe' before matches. Eric Garner, a black man from New York, had uttered the words before he died in a police chokehold during an arrest.\n\nThe same year, commissioner Adam Silver ejected Donald Sterling, then owner of the Los Angeles Clippers, from the league after racist remarks he made about black players emerged.\n\nThe league publicly condemned Sterling and the team was sold.\n\nBut critics say that on the metrics that matter, nothing much has changed. Three-quarters of players in the NBA are black, but only one of the 30 teams has a black majority owner - Michael Jordan of the Charlotte Hornets. As recently as 2017, there were only three black general managers. Now there are six.\n\nAfter retiring from playing, Wallace served as an assistant coach for the Pistons for a season. There were not many like him in the league.\n\n\"We don't get the quote-unquote 'white opportunities' - to be that GM, to be that head coach, assistant GM or partial owner, whatever. That's always up to the white people,\" he says.\n\nIt is another closed door yet to be fully opened - but needs to be, he says, so that youngsters in neighbourhoods like the one he grew up in can see they \"don't have to just play basketball or football or baseball to become someone, to become a significant person in my community, or to even make a lot of money\".\n\nHe adds: \"That's the only outlet that we see as young black men: I gotta make it in basketball or football or baseball. And that's all that we're offered.\"\n\nIt would be hard to argue there has not been any progress.\n\nThe arc of basketball history has bent toward a bit more justice since the 1920s - when black athletes were forced to stay in segregated hotels while travelling through the American South - or even the 1980s, when white players were paid $26,000 more on average, despite poorer performances on the court.\n\nBlack players today have far greater power and command greater respect as public figures, plus the earnings to match. Playing for the Harlem Globetrotters in the 1930s was worth as little as $7.50 a game - $144 (\u00a3111) today - according to basketball historian Doug Merlino, but it was often a choice between that or a life of menial labour.\n\nThe current top five NBA players, all of whom are black, will make a collective $192m (\u00a3147m) on salaries alone over 2019-20.\n\nJames Harden was criticised for wearing this mask with an emblem supporting 'Blue Lives Matter'\n\nThere are those - fans, commentators and players themselves - who will see the limits of sports activism, or reject it altogether.\n\n\"Shut up and dribble\" was the response from Laura Ingraham, a right-wing news anchor, when in 2018 LeBron James gave an ESPN interview criticising President Trump's attitudes on race.\n\nThat Ingraham did not have similar advice more recently for Drew Brees, a white American football player, to keep out of politics have, in many people's view, external-link lent her previous comments a racial tinge. (Brees had made remarks rejecting the take the knee protest in his sport.)\n\nBut the sentiment is not unique to conservative news figures. On plenty of forums and comments below sports talk shows, are complaints from fans decrying the forays of their favourite court stars into politics.\n\nOthers see a heavy dose of hypocrisy in how players, former players and the league handle divisive political issues.\n\nJackson, for example, was engulfed in controversy after making anti-Semitic comments on social media.\n\nHe said his comments were taken out of context, but the episode extinguished a measure of sympathy for his racial activism among many. For some others, it nullified all goodwill entirely.\n\nIn a column for the Hollywood Reporter, external-link Jabbar said Jackson's comments \"undid whatever progress his previous advocacy may have achieved\" by himself committing \"the kind of dehumanising characterisation of a people that causes the police abuses that killed his friend, George Floyd\".\n\nHe wrote of \"a very troubling omen for the future of the Black Lives Matter movement,\" adding: \"So too is the shocking lack of massive indignation.\"\n\nMore recently, Houston Rockets star James Harden drew fury when he was photographed wearing a mask with an emblem supporting 'Blue Lives Matter', a counter-organisation to Black Lives Matter that backs police.\n\nHarden said he was not trying to make a statement - he just thought that the design 'looked cool' and covered his beard.\n\nDetractors will say it proves sportsmen may not be the best agents of political messaging, and that it distracts from the experience fans are paying for with their time and money - a reprieve from politics.\n\nAnd if politics should be allowed to enter in, where should the line be drawn? Another row was stirred up after Josh Hawley, the Republican Missouri Senator, wrote to Silver to complain the NBA is allowing Black Lives Matter-themed slogans, but not those supporting US troops, or backing free speech in Hong Kong.\n\nThe senator accused the NBA of \"excusing and apologising for the brutal repression of the Chinese Communist regime\".\n\n\"Free expression appears to stop at the edge of your corporate sponsors' sensibilities,\" he chided.\n\nBut even if thorny questions remain, there is no doubt that the zeitgeist in America has shifted more broadly.\n\nPoll after poll in 2020 shows that, unlike in the past, Americans are largely accepting the idea that racism exists and plays a part in the many social ills black people face in the country.\n\nThe \"myth\" that America's problems with race are largely overcome is being challenged, whether in basketball or in the greater society, believes Popovich, the 71-year-old Spurs coach.\n\n\"You can't go on and enjoy your life if you don't understand what has happened to so many,\" he says.\n\nAs for the league's race campaign, he is realistic about the prospect of influence.\n\n\"Fans are like any other group of people - some will get it, some will understand, some will just enjoy the games and move on,\" he says.\n\n\"Others will hopefully get involved in being part of the solution of being anti-racist, but that's a pretty individual thing.\"\n\nAfter all, sport - as much a cultural product of the times as any entertainment - can only reflect the realities of its era. In 2020, the reality is that to be black is in itself to be political, and that position is not a choice, whether you are a basketball star or a bouncer.\n\nThe slogan stencilled beside the NBA logo is a reminder. The lives of so many of the men dribbling, jumping, performing feats of athleticism are black ones - and they matter not just on the court."}]}, "theguardian": {"rss": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/rss", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/international", "articles": [{"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/aug/04/beirut-explosion-huge-blast-port-lebanon-capital", "published": "2020-08-05T15:05:11", "title": "Beirut explosion: Lebanon declares two-week state of emergency in capital \u2013 live updates", "text": "13:23\n\nOur correspondent in Moscow, Andrew Roth, has some gripping details on the ship that brought the ammonium nitrate to Beirut:\n\nLittle is known about the Russian owner of the Rhosus, the cargo ship impounded in Beirut in 2014, whose captain had referred to its freight of 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate fertiliser as a \u201cfloating bomb\u201d.\n\nThat ammonium nitrate is believed to have fuelled the devastating explosion that has left more than 100 dead in Beirut.\n\nFormer crew members said the ship was owned by Igor Grechushkin, a Russian national believed to be living in Cyprus, where he holds either citizenship or residency. Grechushkin, a native of the far-eastern city of Khabarovsk, is reported to have managed Teto Shipping, which owned the Rhosus.\n\nThe ship arrived in Beirut in 2013 while sailing from Georgia to Mozambique. It was prevented from leaving the Beirut port in 2014 over an unspecified dispute, either because the ship was deemed not seaworthy or because the owner had failed to pay the necessary fees to the port.\n\nIt was then that Grechushkin is said to have walked away from the ship, refusing to answer calls or negotiate with the port authorities for the release of his sailors.\n\nIn complaints to the press in 2014, former crew members said they had been \u201cabandoned\u201d in Beirut and had not been paid their wages for nearly a year. \u201cThe owner [of the ship] has virtually abandoned the ship and its crew,\u201d wrote the ship\u2019s former captain. \u201cSalaries are not paid, supplies are not purchased.

The ammonium nitrate was confiscated and held at the port in a warehouse.\n\nThe Russian television station Ren TV published a photograph on Wednesday of a man it said was Grechushkin in tight-fitting jeans and sunglasses sitting astride a motorcycle.

It found that the damage benefits smaller, more adaptable creatures that also carry the most pathogens that can pass to humans.\n\nThe assessment found that the populations of animals hosting what are known as zoonotic diseases were up to 2.5 times bigger in degraded places, and that the proportion of species that carry these pathogens increased by up to 70% compared with in undamaged ecosystems.\n\nHumans populations are being increasingly hit by diseases that originate in wild animals, such as HIV, Zika, Sars and Nipah virus. Since the coronavirus pandemic began, there have been a series of warnings from the UN and WHO that the world must tackle the cause of these outbreaks \u2013 the destruction of nature \u2013 and not just the health and economic symptoms.\n\nIn June, experts said the Covid-19 pandemic was an \u201cSOS signal for the human enterprise\u201d, while in April the world\u2019s leading biodiversity experts said even more deadly disease outbreaks were likely unless nature was protected.\n\nThe new analysis is the first to show how the demolition of wild places, as the world\u2019s population and consumption grows, leads to changes in animal populations that increase the risk of disease outbreaks. The research demonstrates that disease surveillance and healthcare needs to be ramped up in those areas where nature is being ravaged, the scientists said.\n\n\u201cAs people go in and, for example, turn a forest into farmland, what they\u2019re doing inadvertently is making it more likely for them to be in contact with an animal that carries disease,\u201d said David Redding, of the ZSL Institute of Zoology in London, who was one of the research team. The work is published in the journal Nature.\n\nRedding said the costs of disease were not being taken into account when deciding to convert natural ecosystems: \u201cYou\u2019ve then got to spend a lot more money on hospitals and treatments.\u201d A recent report estimated that just 2% of the costs of the Covid-19 crisis would be needed to help prevent future pandemics for a decade.\n\n\u201cThe Covid-19 pandemic has awakened the world to the threat that zoonotic diseases pose to humans,\u201d said Richard Ostfeld, at the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies, US, and Felicia Keesing at Bard College, US, in a commentary in Nature.\n\n\u201cWith this recognition has come a widespread misperception that wild nature is the greatest source of zoonotic disease,\u201d they said. \u201c[This research] offers an important correction: the greatest zoonotic threats arise where natural areas have been converted to croplands, pastures and urban areas. The patterns the researchers detected were striking.\u201d\n\nThe reason for species such as rodents and bats simultaneously thriving in ecosystems damaged by humans and also hosting the most pathogens is probably because they are small, mobile, adaptable and produce lots of offspring rapidly.\n\n\u201cThe ultimate example is the brown rat,\u201d Redding said. These fast-living species have an evolutionary strategy that favours large numbers of offspring ahead of a high survival rate for each one, which means they invest relatively little in their immune systems. \u201cIn other words, creatures that have rat-like life histories seem to be more tolerant of infections than do other creatures,\u201d said Ostfeld and Keesing.\n\n\u201cIn contrast, an elephant has a calf every couple of years,\u201d said Redding. \u201cIt has to make sure that offspring survives, so it is born with a very strong and adaptive immune system.\u201d\n\nThe analysis found that small, perching birds were also disease hosts that do well in habitats suffering from the impact of human activities. Such birds can be reservoirs of diseases such as West Nile virus and a type of chikungunya virus.\n\nHumans have already affected more than half of the Earth\u2019s habitable land. Prof Kate Jones, of the University College London, and also part of the research team, said: \u201cAs agricultural and urban lands are predicted to continue expanding in the coming decades, we should be strengthening disease surveillance and healthcare provision in those areas that are undergoing a lot of land disturbance, as they are increasingly likely to have animals that could be hosting harmful pathogens.\u201d"}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/aug/05/press-hounded-caroline-flack-her-mother-tells-inquest", "published": "2020-08-05T12:59:44", "title": "Press hounded Caroline Flack, her mother tells inquest", "text": "The mother of TV presenter Caroline Flack, who was found hanged at her north London home in February, said her daughter had faced a \u201cshow trial\u201d and been hounded by the press over allegations she assaulted her boyfriend in the weeks before she took her life, an inquest heard.\n\nIn a statement read to court, Chris Flack said: \u201cI believe Caroline was seriously let down by the authorities and in particular the CPS for pursuing the case.\u201d\n\nThe 40-year-old, who hosted Love Island and The X Factor, was found dead at her flat in Stoke Newington on 15 February.

Unlike opiates, there is no readily available overdose reversal drug for these fake tablets within communities. The drug used to reverse benzodiazepines is carried by ambulance crews and in hospitals so it\u2019s vital that anyone feeling unwell after taking these tablets seeks medical help.\u201d\n\nIn many cases where hospitalisation or death has occurred, other drugs were involved.

After the Troubles erupted he co-founded the SDLP, became an MP and MEP, and spent three decades arguing for an \u201cagreed Ireland\u201d shared peacefully by unionists and nationalists. He enlisted support from successive administrations in Dublin, London, Brussels and Washington.\n\nViewers in a 2010 RT\u00c9 poll voted Hume the greatest person in Irish history.\n\nOn Tuesday night candles in windows and doors lit a path for the funeral cortege as it wound to the cathedral.

Large swathes of the island remain unexplored and some historical collections have yet to be looked at. Researchers estimate that 4,000 more plant species could be found in the next 50 years, with discoveries showing \u201cno sign of levelling off\u201d, according to the paper published in Nature.\n\n\u201cIt is a paradise teeming with life,\u201d said lead researcher Dr Rodrigo C\u00e1mara-Leret, a biologist from the University of Zurich who was previously at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.\n\nNew Guinea \u2013 which is divided into the Indonesian provinces of Papua and West Papua and the independent state of Papua New Guinea in the east \u2013 is the most mountainous and largest tropical island in the world, with snowcapped peaks reaching 5,000 metres high.\n\n\u201cThis allows for different types of habitats, such as mangroves, swamp forests, lowland tropical forests and also montane forests, which have high levels of endemism,\u201d said C\u00e1mara-Leret. \u201cAnd then at the very top, just below the limit of plant growth, are these alpine grasslands \u2026 This habitat is basically unique to New Guinea in southeast Asia.\u201d\n\nThe island sits between Malaysia, Australia and the Pacific and has a young and diverse geological history, with many species forming in the last million years. One of the most surprising discoveries was how many plants are exclusive to the island. For example, 98% of heather species are endemic, as are 96% of African violets and 95% of ginger species.\n\nA local guide with a rhododendron in bloom in the Cromwell mountains of Papua New Guinea. Photograph: William J Baker/RBG Kew\n\nMany suspected that New Guinea would prove to have the highest diversity, but botanical exploration on the island remains limited. Unlike Madagascar \u2013 which has had a species checklist since 2008 \u2013 the island had never been systematically surveyed and previous estimates suggested it could have anything between 9,000 to 25,000 species.\n\nIn total researchers found 13,634 species of plants divided into 1,742 genera and 264 families. \u201cI was just pleased that we could nail a number. This is not the end, this is a first step,\u201d said C\u00e1mara-Leret, who is encouraging researchers from around the world to build on this dataset, which will be vital for International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List assessments.\n\nNew Guinea has fascinated explorers and botanists for centuries. In 1700 Englishman William Dampier brought back the earliest scientific specimens from the region, which inspired decades of European exploration. In 1770, Joseph Banks, who was on Captain\u2019s Cook\u2019s voyage, collected a sedge \u2013 one of the earliest known samples to be included in the study. The taxonomy of the region slowly built up, with plants being collected and taken to different institutions around the world.\n\nHowever, inland areas remained inaccessible until after the second world war and base camps could only be established with the use of aircraft. These mountainous regions proved to be the most diverse and in the past 50 years, 2,800 new species have been recorded.\n\nBotanists looked through more than 700,000 specimens. Included in the finds were more than 2,800 species of orchid and 3,900 species of tree. \u201cPart of the study\u2019s beauty is its sheer scale and just the huge number of collaborators,\u201d said C\u00e1mara-Leret, who started the project in 2018. \u201cThere was already a sense of New Guinea community, but it was scattered, and this project kind of brought us all together.\u201d\n\nSome veteran scientists involved in the study had lived on the island for decades, and many had spent their careers studying the taxonomy of a single plant family. \u201cIt united people across different generations, like scientists who are just starting up, then early career researchers and then folks who have been retired for over 20 years. We had a lot of scientists that are retired, collaborating and giving up freely their time \u2026 They have an enormous amount of knowledge and very few people are learning it from them,\u201d said C\u00e1mara-Leret.\n\nAnother reason it has taken so long to create a list for the island is because the region has been governed by so many different European powers. Colonial education was focused on extracting materials and agricultural work, so taxonomic knowledge was limited. After independence, there was a new generation of scientists committed to doing research but the system stifled their enthusiasm.\n\nGenus Freycinetia, with 140 species, is a group of forest climbers in the Pandanaceae family, one of the 20 most-diverse groups in New Guinea.

Researchers hope it will encourage the two governments to produce a new generation of botanists who will inform better conservation in the future. But botanical exploration is urgently needed to ensure unknown species can be collected before they disappear.\n\n\u201cIt is clear, in the context of the biodiversity crisis, that this paper represents a milestone in our understanding of the New Guinea flora and provides a vital platform to accelerate scientific research and conservation,\u201d said Dr Peter Wilkie from the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh, who was involved in the study. \u201cResearch at its best is collaborative and this demonstrates what can be achieved when scientists from around the world work together and share expertise and data.\u201d\n\nDr Sandra Knapp, a botanist from the Natural History Museum who was also involved in the project, described it as an \u201cincredible achievement\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis should now serve as a baseline for much more work and discovery in the years to come,\u201d she said.\n\nFind more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/aug/05/coronavirus-live-news-trump-pressed-on-false-death-rate-claim-as-europe-faces-second-wave", "published": "2020-08-05T15:10:43", "title": "Coronavirus live news: Greece blames complacency for 'significant rise' in cases; global death toll passes 700,000", "text": "12:41\n\nThe Greek prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, has blamed \u201ccomplacency\u201d for the country\u2019s \u201csignificant rise\u201d in coronavirus cases in recent days.\n\nIn a week deemed crucial for containing further transmission spread, the centre-right leader echoed the mounting concern of infectious disease experts over an abrupt increase in infections.

And for that I believe we all bear a responsibility. Just 10% of cases are imported; most cases right now are domestic.\u201d\n\nThe government has repeatedly warned it will re-introduce restrictions including local lockdowns if need be. Face coverings have been made compulsory in enclosed spaces, and officials have said masks must be worn in open-air decks on ferries as the country gears up for a mass exodus expected to occur before 15 August \u2013 the date of a major religious celebration in the Orthodox calendar.\n\nMitsotakis, who has only intermittently addressed Greeks on the issue of coronavirus, deferring at the height of the initial lockdown to scientists instead, urged citizens not to let down their guard, saying masks should be seen as \u201ca constant companion\u201d. He said face coverings must be donned not only in closed spaces but also outside in circumstances where it is impossible to maintain social distancing. \u201cThe mask should now become a constant companion, like our keys, our glasses, our mobile phone,\u201d he added, before calling on Greeks to reject conspiracy theories doing the rounds debunking the efficacy of face coverings and other precautionary measures.\n\nThe abrupt rise \u2013 especially noticeable among younger people in recent weeks \u2013 has brought the total number of cases to 4,855, and epidemiologists have described the coming days as make-or-break for the country\u2019s continued ability to keep the virus under control.

A YouGov survey released this week found that two-thirds of people (65%) would cancel if masks were mandatory at all times, 43% would still cancel if only compulsory inside, while 70% would scrap the holiday if they had to quarantine on return.\n\nThe results come as the industry continues to face cancellations and redundancies, after Spain was removed from the UK government\u2019s travel corridor list on 26 July. The World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) has forecast 3 million job losses across the UK tourism sector with \u201cuncoordinated\u201d restrictions deterring travellers.\n\nThe survey also found that 93% would cancel if quarantine was required on arrival in their holiday destination. Rules on quarantine measures and masks vary from country to country, and can change without warning, as spikes in some regions result in restrictions and safety measures being reinstated. Travellers are being advised to carry a mask at all times, and be prepared to wear it in public and in some hotels.\n\nAcross France, fines can now be imposed for not wearing a mask in places such as parks, markets and city centres; wearing one is already mandatory in enclosed public spaces and shops. Belgium, Italy, Germany, Spain and Turkey have also made it mandatory in many public spaces, but enforcement and fines vary.\n\nIn the Netherlands, masks are compulsory only on public transport; it\u2019s the same in Portugal, Switzerland and Greece \u2013 Greece also requires masks in medical facilities and lifts, while they are only \u201cstrongly recommended\u201d elsewhere in public. Across the majority of the Nordic region, Estonia and the Czech Republic, masks are not compulsory, but advisable for situations where you cannot socially distance.\n\nThe UK government changed its advice for Spain on 26 July \u2013 with all arrivals to the UK from the country now facing a 14-day self-isolation period.

While we acknowledge the UK government\u2019s efforts to support travel and tourism during this crisis, the UK alone looks set to lose three million jobs in the sector, creating an economic black hole of \u00a3142bn in the country\u2019s finances. This is due to an international failure to implement proper coordination to combat the pandemic.\u201d\n\nIn contrast with the YouGov poll, the WTTC believes masks would encourage more people to travel, if rules were consistent across the world. Guevara said: \u201cWe still have time to turn this around if we act together now and replace ineffective quarantines with comprehensive rapid testing, a worldwide accepted standard of contact tracing and widespread face mask usage. Employing the latest technology, combined with mass adoption of protective face coverings, will help restore confidence to the traveller.\u201d\n\nOne of the most recent companies to face cuts is Hays Travel, which announced this week that it was in consultation on almost 900 redundancies. The company took on more than 2,000 Thomas Cook employees when the venerable firm went under last October, but have said that they \u201chad no choice\u201d following the government\u2019s decision to advise against travel to Spain, and with imminent changes in furlough conditions.\n\nOwners Irene and John Hays said on BBC Breakfast on Tuesday: \u201cThere\u2019s clear evidence that just before a week ago last Saturday [the day before rules for Spain changed] the figures were coming back steadily and we were really pleased with the return of new bookings \u2013 not just for 2021, where we\u2019re actually performing quite strongly, but steadily coming in for summer 2020, which would have helped recover the position in terms of staffing.\n\n\u201cWe believe a more nuanced approach would be more appropriate. The Canaries and Balearics have low infection rates. We believe the government could still change that and we could recover the summer.\u201d\n\n\n\n"}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/05/schools-reopening-in-england-risks-sharp-rise-in-covid-cases-says-expert", "published": "2020-08-05T14:16:00", "title": "Schools reopening in England risks sharp rise in Covid cases, says expert", "text": "As ministers and teachers wrestle with the challenge of safely opening schools in England in September, a former government adviser, Neil Ferguson, threw another spanner in the works by suggesting older teenagers could transmit the virus as well as adults.\n\nFerguson told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cThe risk then is that big schools, comprehensives, universities, FE [further education] colleges link lots of households together, reconnect the social network, which social distancing measures have deliberately disconnected. And that poses a real risk of amplification of transmission, of case numbers going up quite sharply.\u201d\n\nA South Korean study published in a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention journal last month found Covid infection rates among household contacts to be highest where they resided with someone with the virus in the 10- to 19-year-old age group.

It is unclear whether older students transmit more, or if physical distancing is practically unfeasible in classrooms at high capacity.\u201d\n\nHowever, the same phenomenon was not observed in Denmark and Norway, countries with lower community transmission than Germany, the study found. The picture is further complicated by research that found that children under five with mild to moderate Covid-19 have a much higher viral load.\n\nPaul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said: \u201cMy best guess is that an infected young child is more infectious but teenagers have many more close contacts and so are more likely to spread the infection.\n\n\u201cIf you look at Sweden, that country kept its primary schools open but closed its secondary schools and higher education institutions. So maybe that was enough to suppress the R value a bit.\u201d\n\nSeveral experts suggest greater social contact might explain older children being more likely to spread the virus than their younger counterparts. However, Dr Sarah Lewis, senior lecturer in genetic epidemiology at the University of Bristol, said: \u201cThis could also be due to different immune mechanisms among younger children.\u201d\n\nA Public Health England (PHE) source said the risk cited by Ferguson was \u201cvery much our understanding\u201d. They added: \u201cIt means that we are going to have to be careful about the reopening. Overall, though, we must really bear in mind the harms caused to children by not going back to school and, at a population scale, this may well be much larger than that of Covid.\u201d\n\nIt highlights why the government\u2019s advisers on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) have been trumpeting the importance of a robust test-and-trace system and continued social distancing if the return of children to school is not to cause a surge in new Covid cases."}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/05/i-had-to-hide-myself-again-young-lgbt-people-on-their-life-in-uk-lockdown", "published": "2020-08-05T05:00:22", "title": "'I had to hide myself again': young LGBT people on their life in UK lockdown", "text": "The experiences of LGBTQ people across the UK during lockdown have been as diverse as the community itself. Married and cohabiting older gay men and lesbians have mainly felt the pandemic has had no more impact on them than on their heterosexual peers. But for many of the more than 200 respondents to the Guardian\u2019s callout, the past few months have brought significant challenges, including weeks of homophobia, biphobia and transphobia, increased isolation and deteriorating mental health.\n\nYounger LGBTQ people reported that lockdown meant being confined with families who were unsupportive or hostile. Kate, a 24-year-old bisexual demi-girl, meaning she identifies as a woman but not completely, said moving from her flat in Glasgow back into her childhood home in Ayrshire had meant hiding her sexuality again.\n\nDaniel Norman: \u2018We have to put parts of our queer selves away when we navigate our parents\u2019 homes.\u2019\n\n\u201cBeing with parents who disagree with my very existence, with no one else or nowhere else to go for refuge, was tough,\u201d said the visual merchandiser and sculptor. \u201cI had to hide myself again. If I wanted to read a queer book I had to make sure I had something to hide the cover. I had to watch queer movies behind closed doors and hoped no one walked in and gawked at the screen.\u201d\n\nMany trans people said relatives did not respect their identities. One trans non-binary couple, Hester and Nik, who both use the pronouns they/them, spent lockdown with Hester\u2019s parents in Suffolk, who they said \u201cmisgendered us both consistently\u201d. Hester added: \u201cMy mum is pretty transphobic so we avoid a lot of topics, such as JK Rowling and gender-neutral toilets. It can feel invalidating, although we get on most of the time.\u201d\n\nFor a few respondents, lockdown pushed them to demand more acceptance from their families. Huz Hussein, 31, a gay software engineer from Manchester, who lived with his family before lockdown, said being around them constantly made him feel he had \u201cno choice but to open more about who and what I am\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cEven though I am out to my mum, dad, sisters and brother, I was fed up living two lives. I am not out to my extended family and people in the local mosque community. I told my mum I felt as though I was still living a lie and I can\u2019t be me around those people.\n\nJack Cullen: supported \u2018a drag queen disowned by her family ... on an estate where kids shout abuse at her\u2019.\n\n\u201cShe said, \u2018go tell anyone you want and I will stand by you and support you. You are my son and I love you.\u2019 I know my mum still struggles with the idea of me being gay but every day she understands it more. And all she really wants is for me to be happy.\u201d\n\nYounger people, even those who were out to their parents, commonly said that going back to living with them had adversely affected their mental health. Daniel Norman, 24, a gay man from London, said his anxiety \u201cprogressively got worse\u201d when he moved to his parents\u2019 house in Surrey in March. \u201cWhile I am out to my parents, I struggled to be away from my friends in London where I am more openly queer than I can be at home,\u201d he said, adding that his isolation was compounded by staying in a village with no visible LGBTQ community.\n\n\u201cIt feels like the work that queer people have put into coming out, finding community, discovering themselves has been reversed and now we have to put parts of our queer selves away when we navigate our hometowns and parents\u2019 homes. I have only started to feel part of a community of other queer people in the past year, and was really starting to discover a lot about myself. So it was incredibly destructive to suddenly have that taken away from me.\u201d\n\nNorman, who was seeing a specialist LGBTQ counsellor before lockdown, was one of many respondents who expressed concerns about their mental health and the loss of access to dedicated support services. Jack Cullen, from Stepney Green, in east London, who works with LGBTQ venues such as the Glory in Haggerston, said he went to check on two friends in acute distress, one of whom talked about jumping off his balcony. Cullen drew a contrast between the lives of wealthy and privileged MPs who broke lockdown and his desire to support \u201ca drag queen disowned by her family forced to sit in a windowless room for three months, except for a few laps around an estate where kids shout abuse at her\u201d.\n\nJamie Wake: \u2018People underestimate the value of a local LGBT community.\u2019\n\nMost trans respondents said their distress was compounded by medical treatment being cancelled, including gender confirmation surgery. Hester\u2019s partner, Nik, 27, a queer trans student physiotherapist, said the cancellation of their top surgery (bilateral mastectomy) was devastating \u201chaving jumped through many hoops to get referred to a surgeon\u201d.\n\nThe loss of access to LGBTQ venues, such as pubs and clubs, events, such as Pride, and community services, such as youth groups and social networks, was another widespread concern. Many respondents feared the post-pandemic recession would lead to these businesses and services closing completely, as many were already in a precarious financial state.\n\nBronagh, a lesbian who works in media tech in London, said: \u201cBefore Covid, I made it a point to go to LGBT+ theatre, bars. Since lockdown began, just seeing fewer non-heteronormative people in daily life definitely makes you feel more like an island.\u201d\n\nJamie Wake, 42, a social care bid manager from Reading, helped set up a weekly event called SaturGAY to replace the one regular LGBTQ club night in the town closed by the pandemic. \u201cIt was established to combat social isolation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a quiz night with phone-ins and entertainment. Reading is similar to other provincial towns in that several LGBT venues have closed in recent years. People underestimate the value of a local LGBT community. Dedicated safe spaces are good for mental health.\u201d"}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/aug/05/christmas-panto-cancellations-theatres-uk-industry", "published": "2020-08-05T12:55:39", "title": "Not just for Christmas: panto cancellations threaten theatres' future", "text": "It\u2019s like a scene from How the Grinch Stole Christmas. Dozens of pantomimes across the land have been cancelled or postponed due to uncertainty about easing lockdown restrictions for theatres. On Wednesday it was announced that pantos at King\u2019s theatre in Edinburgh, His Majesty\u2019s theatre in Aberdeen and Belfast\u2019s Grand Opera House have been pushed back to 2021. All three are produced by the huge Qdos operation whose pantomimes are seen by more than two million people each festive season.\n\nKing\u2019s theatre puts on the bestselling panto in Scotland, playing to audiences of more than 90,000 each year. It provides nearly 30% of the annual income for its operator, Capital Theatres, and the postponement will result in a \u00a32.3m loss. Fiona Gibson, chief executive of Capital Theatres, said it was the \u201cbiggest blow to date\u201d of the perilous months that have left the UK theatre industry in crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nMichael Harrison, joint owner of Qdos, has been calling for greater clarity about the timing for stages four and five of the UK government\u2019s roadmap to reopening theatres, which would permit larger audiences for indoor performances. For Qdos\u2019s panto season to happen \u201cas we know it\u201d, Harrison said he needed to know target dates for reopening by the start of August. With culture secretary Oliver Dowden\u2019s recent confirmation that a timeframe is now unlikely to be given until November at earliest, Qdos says it is left with no choice but to consult with its partner theatres about the viability of each Christmas show.\n\nThough it is only August, pantos take months to prepare and many venues and producers have been unable to commit to spending money on shows that might be scrapped. Theatr Clwyd in Mold, the Tron in Glasgow and Sheffield Theatres are among those that have already postponed their pantos until next year. On Monday, Canterbury\u2019s Marlowe theatre did the same. Its Christmas production is normally seen by 100,000 people. On Tuesday, Theatre Royal Wakefield said it was not only postponing its panto but was remaining closed until spring 2021 due to the ongoing wait not just for clarity from the government about theatre reopenings but also for exactly how the \u00a31.57bn arts rescue package would be made available to struggling venues.\n\nMany UK households who consider a pantomime one of the essential trimmings of Christmas will be disappointed not to make a date with their local panto dame. But the effects of the cancellations will be felt deeply for theatres long beyond the festive season. As Andrew Lloyd Webber recently said, pantos are the \u201clifeblood\u201d of regional theatre.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Civic Arts centre and theatre, in Oswaldtwistle, has up to 2,000 visitors a week\n\nGayle Knight is the creative director of Civic Arts centre and theatre in Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire. Christmas, she says, is \u201cour big income generator, like for every other theatre in the country\u201d. They get packed houses for the panto for two straight weeks and attract many school groups. \u201cWe\u2019ve already heard from headteachers in the area that they won\u2019t be coming to the panto this year because it will be too difficult,\u201d she says.\n\nIndoor performances with social distancing are set to be allowed from later this month. If still in place by winter, the rule would mean the 457-seat theatre would have an audience of 140. \u201cThat makes it completely unviable at our traditionally busiest period,\u201d says Knight. \u201cIf we don\u2019t have a good Christmas then we really struggle in January and February, which is our quietest time.\u201d\n\nIf we don\u2019t have a good Christmas then we really struggle in January Gayle Knight\n\nThe Civic would have been celebrating its 10th anniversary this month. The venue is in an area currently under stricter lockdown rules than other parts of the UK, and Knight is planning to reopen in September. Her team of eight has been furloughed. \u201cIf we can\u2019t open fully for Christmas then that\u2019s when we\u2019ll have problems,\u201d she says. The theatre may put on an Easter panto instead. They have had small grants from the local council and from Arts Council England\u2019s emergency fund, and have fundraised. Knight hopes the government will consider extending the furlough scheme beyond October for small venues like hers, rather than ending it at a time when full indoor performances may still not be permitted. Otherwise, she says, the Civic will be open but unable to trade properly and \u201cit negates the good work that the government has done done on job retention\u201d.\n\nThe Civic has a vital role in the community. Before the pandemic, the building was buzzing. As many as 2,000 people a week visit the centre, not just to watch shows but for activities including dance classes, drama groups, knitting and photography classes. Knight remembers when a group of parents came to see their children\u2019s drama show and enjoyed it so much they decided to put on their own production. If the Civic wasn\u2019t there, its community would have to travel a considerable distance for a similar provision, she says. When a small theatre in a small town closes, she adds, it will likely remain closed for ever.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest James Worthington and Justine Lee in Father Christmas Needs a Wee, a two-hander musical produced by TaleGate\n\nIn recent years, the Civic\u2019s panto has been provided by TaleGate touring company, whose artistic director (and frequent dame) is James Worthington. They stage pantomimes in several venues of a similar size to the Civic and visit schools and social clubs. Between 40-60% of TaleGate\u2019s panto ticket sales are from schools and they are waiting to hear whether those schools will book this year. Unlike larger theatres and touring enterprises, TaleGate can act nimbly and don\u2019t need to decide yet on which productions they can stage. They have two musical Christmas shows that are performed by only two actors, with one accompanying technician, making social distancing easier and allowing greater flexibility. One of the reasons they keep the productions small is so tickets are affordable \u2013 part of their mission is to bring theatre to audiences who might not otherwise experience it.\n\nPanto has given generations of people their first taste of theatre. There is a risk, this year, that a new intake of panto fans will miss out \u2013 and these would be the theatregoers of the future. \u201cIf we don\u2019t have panto this year, are families going to fall out of the habit and not return next year,\u201d asks Worthington. And if audiences get used to watching theatre online, he adds, will they come back for the real thing?\n\nGood tidings he brings! Johnny McKnight, Scotland's panto powerhouse Read more\n\nThe thing that makes panto special \u2013 its boisterous interactivity \u2013 is what makes it problematic during a pandemic. These are shows that shower the audience with sweets, dragoon audiences into ridiculous situations on stage and involve as much shouting as possible. The Tron in Glasgow, which is postponing The Wonderful Wizard of Oz written, directed and performed by Johnny McKnight, said in a statement that, beyond the financial risk, \u201cwe very much feel that pantomime needs to be enjoyed in a packed auditorium\u201d. Interaction is integral to the experience, it said, and anything different \u201cwould be shortchanging our audiences\u201d.\n\nPantomime, Worthington stresses, is at the heart of the theatre ecology. He quotes the title of a book about Salisbury Playhouse: Putting on Panto to Pay for the Pinter. The Christmas box-office bounty enables regional theatres to stage a variety of other work. Those venues are themselves inseparable from the more prominent, better-funded organisations in bigger towns on the UK theatre map. Snobbery about panto and regional theatre persists. Small, rural theatres such as the Civic are often thought of as a \u201cpoor relative to the larger venues\u201d, says Knight, but are a \u201cbreeding ground for talent. Without us, many of the stars of the West End wouldn\u2019t be where they are today. We are equally as professional as larger venues but on a more modest budget and with more modest ambition.\u201d\n\nWorthington is concerned that the government\u2019s \u00a31.57bn emergency culture funding will show a bias to arts \u201cwith a capital A\u201d such as what Dowden called the \u201ccrown jewel\u201d buildings. \u201cIn the rural locations we go to,\u201d Worthington stresses, \u201cthese regional venues are the crown jewel to that community.\u201d\n\nThe great fear is that by next Christmas, for some regions, it won\u2019t just be a panto that is missing \u2013 but the theatre itself."}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/aug/05/metro-bank-back-office-staff-can-work-from-home-until-after-flu-season-covid-19", "published": "2020-08-05T10:46:43", "title": "Metro Bank office staff can work from home until after flu season", "text": "Metro Bank will not urge staff to return to the office until the winter flu season is over but it is ramping up hiring to handle a surge in defaults linked to the Covid-19 crisis.\n\nThe chief executive, Daniel Frumkin, said he would not ask its 1,400 head office and back-office employees to return to their desks before 2021, given the potential for a rise in coronavirus cases during the winter months.\n\n\u201cEverybody tells me, you know, flu season will be difficult and it doesn\u2019t seem prudent to let people back in the office in October, staring into a winter that could be very difficult.

An internal survey found that only 4% of Metro\u2019s head and back-office staff wanted to return to the office five days a week.\n\nThe homeworking trend also meant the bank was able to close its Old Bailey back-office site more than a year earlier than expected.

But sending many patients to hospital could not continue indefinitely because \u201ceverything has a limit\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe number of people in hospital has increased primarily but not only because of transfers from aged care and a lot of those transfers are not for clinical [reasons], not because they\u2019re sick but because of infection control reasons,\u201d Cheng said.\n\nThe comment prompted the health minister, Jenny Mikakos, to interrupt to state: \u201cSo we do have some capacity to continue to absorb more residents from aged care facilities.\n\nHow Covid-19 laid bare the cracks in Australia\u2019s aged care system Read more\n\n\u201cTo date we have had more than 300 aged care facility residents transferred to either public or private hospitals,\u201d Mikakos said. \u201cObviously those decisions are made on a clinical-care basis, it can be very traumatic for aged care residents to be transferred from what is their home \u2026 to a hospital environment, but we won\u2019t hesitate to do that.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile Andrews said non-urgent surgery in regional areas would stop in order to boost hospital capacity to treat Covid-19 patients, with increasing cases outside of metropolitan Melbourne. Nurses from public and private hospitals have also been brought in to aged care homes, reducing their availability for surgery.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t have a situation where we are making the sickest patients wait longer because we are treating wholly worthy and important conditions, but not necessarily time-critical conditions,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cWe can\u2019t put those ahead of people who need that urgent care. The sickest patients must get treated quickest. That is always a principle that our public and indeed private hospitals work under. This is a regrettable decision but it is a very important one in order to preserve sufficient capacity in our entire health system.\u201d\n\nOf the 725 new cases of the virus, 164 are linked to outbreaks including those in aged care and 561 under investigation.

He oversaw the brutal end of the country\u2019s 26-year civil war against Tamil insurgents and was credibly accused of curtailing civil and political freedoms and committing human rights abuses against Tamils and political opponents.\n\nThe major challenger among a bitterly divided opposition is Sajith Premadasa, who was defeated in November\u2019s presidential contest, and then broke away from the United National party (UNP) to form his own group.

Incidents ranged from misogynistic jokes on stage to sexual comments from people in power, and a chillingly common refrain \u2013 \u201cI got off lightly\u201d \u2013 in the face of physical harassment.\n\nAlready, Duddy has experienced a promoter making inappropriate advances while they were alone in a car. Calnan had a \u201ccreepy and uncomfortable\u201d incident when she was publicly sexualised by a promoter. For women who have worked in UK comedy for longer, these stories are familiar. When allegations of sexual misconduct against US comedian Chris D\u2019Elia (which he denies) emerged in June, people here used Twitter to disclose their experiences with men in the UK industry. Some had already spoken out about experiences within UK comedy in 2017, when the #MeToo movement went global. Some even created comedy shows about the problem.\n\nThree years on, the industry has barely changed. Just this week, the presenter and comedian Hardeep Singh Kohli apologised on Twitter for making women feel \u201cintimidated, undermined and undervalued\u201d.\n\nThe UK comedy circuit consists of networks of promoters and venues where, theoretically, anyone can take to the stage, with the hopes of progressing to dedicated comedy clubs, solo tours and TV. Yet, according to female performers, producers, agents and promoters in comedy I have spoken to, there is a deeply rooted sexism in the comedy scene that undermines the confidence and humanity of women, emboldens sexual predators and prevents people from speaking out.\n\nThe industry is still male-dominated. Artists describe a vicious cycle where, despite more women now trying open-mic comedy, numbers are thinned out higher up by promoters who never book more than one woman per show and use the comparative lack of famous female comics as \u201cevidence\u201d that women aren\u2019t funny.\n\n\u2018You do so much to play down your femaleness\u2019 \u2026 Fern Brady. Photograph: Alecsandra Raluca Dr\u0103goi/The Guardian\n\nThe industry is still male-dominated. Acts describe a vicious cycle where despite more women now trying open-mic comedy, numbers are thinned out higher up by promoters who never book more than one woman per show and use the comparative lack of famous female comics as \u201cevidence\u201d women aren\u2019t funny. Almost everyone has been belittled on stage. Fern Brady is one of multiple comedians who experienced a compere shouting \u2018I shagged her\u2019 after her performance.\n\nTaking the stage after sexist jokes have been told is also common and sets the tone for conduct in the green room. Kate Smurthwaite, who has been a comedian for 16 years, says the job provides a foil; if people are being \u201ctoxic and sexist, they go: \u2018It\u2019s supposed to be a joke.\u2019\u201d Ania Magliano, who has performed comedy for around three years, recalls a friend confronting a comedian\u2019s inappropriate behaviour: \u201cHe said he was doing it in character.\u201d\n\nWomen describe feeling pressured to brush off misconduct in order to fit in. \u201cYou had to have the blinkers on and laugh about insane stuff,\u201d Brady says. \u201cYou do so much to play down your femaleness \u2013 I wore a little suit jacket, I wouldn\u2019t wear earrings \u2013 but sexual assault firmly puts you back in your place.\u201d\n\nStandup Alison Spittle agrees: \u201cWe keep getting told we\u2019re not funny enough \u2013 you feel you have to be too funny to assault. I thought: \u2018If I work hard enough, I can be treated with respect.\u2019 But it never ends.\u201d\n\nWithin comedy\u2019s unregulated power structure, progression depends on networking and impressing gatekeepers. When new acts meet a comedian or promoter who says they\u2019ll help their career, it sounds like a great opportunity. However, women described to me how professional interactions were quickly sexualised.\n\nNina Gilligan began standup in 2011. Not long after she started, she was invited to perform a paid corporate gig by a man in the industry who had offered to help further her comedy career. He had been calling her frequently, making her feel uncomfortable, but the nature of the gig reassured her that his intentions were professional. He told her the job came with hotel accommodation: \u201cI arrived and asked the front desk where I would be sleeping. They told me I\u2019d be sharing a room with him.\u201d\n\nGilligan was alarmed. Two women overheard and said she could stay in their room. She confronted the man before the show \u2013 he \u201cbluffed\u201d his way out of responsibility.\n\nAfter the show, once she\u2019d had too many drinks to escape by car, he sexually assaulted her: \u201cI remember thinking, I need to get away from him.\u201d\n\nUnable to find the women who had offered their room, another comedian pointed her to a dormitory with spare beds. \u201cI woke up to this man who had abused me earlier in the night in bed with me. He had his hands on me. I was like: \u2018Get out!\u2019 I remember curling up in a ball at the end of the bed. I woke up again as it was coming light \u2013 he was in the bed again with his hands on me.\u201d\n\n\u2018The hotel staff told me I\u2019d be sharing a room with this man\u2019 ... Nina Gilligan. Photograph: Rara photography\n\nGilligan later discovered that other women had had negative experiences with this man. Being new to the circuit when he approached her, she hadn\u2019t heard the stories in time.\n\nKnowing the limitations of the \u201cwhisper network\u201d, some women speak directly to new performers. Brady says: \u201cI\u2019m giving advice to my younger self: \u2018You\u2019re not imagining this. It is as bad as you think it is.\u2019\u201d Spittle adds: \u201cI would like to have coffee with new women where they ask for advice about jokes instead of: \u2018Which gigs do I not do so I don\u2019t get assaulted?\u2019\u201d\n\nWorking conditions can exacerbate the issues: late nights, alcohol, travelling with strangers. Robyn Perkins, a standup for eight years, has experienced the danger of power imbalances in these situations. As a new comic, she was driven three hours to a gig by an established male comedian. On the drive back, he groped her: \u201cI was in the middle of the motorway, alone in a car with this guy. I didn\u2019t want it to happen, but because of the power dynamic, if I\u2019d gone: \u2018This is not OK\u2019, he could\u2019ve made me get out of the car on the motorway at midnight.\u201d She also feared he would tell the promoter they had worked for not to book her again.\n\n\u2018If people are being sexist, they say \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be a joke\u201d\u2019 ... Kate Smurthwaite. Photograph: Charlotte Barnes\n\nSome promoters offer their spare rooms to performers who cannot get home. On one occasion when Smurthwaite accepted, the promoter crept up on her in the kitchen, put his hands on her and called her a \u201cporn star\u201d. But she has also experienced similar behaviour in more public settings, including: \u201cguys getting their genitals out and rubbing them against me, things where there is no interpretation of events that isn\u2019t: \u2018This is sexual assault.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe women I spoke to described how the \u201cgrey area\u201d of some incidents stopped them reporting. Others don\u2019t want an assault to define them, so keep it to themselves. Many agreed that raising concerns leads to loss of work and online abuse, or felt invalidated after confiding in colleagues, only to see them continue to work with alleged perpetrators. \u201cWhat you see on Twitter is only the tip of the iceberg,\u201d Magliano says. \u201cRemember that some people aren\u2019t coming forward \u2013 there are lots who don\u2019t feel safe and people who are legally unable to.\u201d The lack of HR structures or a comedy industry union means most don\u2019t know where to turn. This leaves some with a burden of guilt that the man in question will strike again.\n\n\u201cOften, it\u2019s not safe to come forward, because the victim just doesn\u2019t get booked again,\u201d says Perkins.\n\nWhen Spittle spoke publicly of misconduct, she received abuse from anonymous accounts on Twitter. She says that there are places where she can no longer work. \u201cPeople mistake professionalism for being quiet,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it is professional to try and improve working conditions. I hope people who speak out are not treated as troublemakers. It\u2019s the opposite \u2013 the abusers should be seen as trouble.\u201d\n\nMagliano says this aspect of comedy culture needs to change: \u201cThere has to be industry-wide action that shows women who speak out against abusers won\u2019t be seen as \u2018difficult\u2019. It\u2019s hard when you\u2019re doing something you enjoy for your career to then do something that would jeopardise it.\u201d\n\n\u2018You\u2019re constantly weighing up how much morality your career can withstand\u2019 ... Kiri Pritchard-McLean. Photograph: Carla Speight/Getty Images\n\nKiri Pritchard-McLean says she avoids working with men she knows have harassed others, but this means losing work: \u201cYou\u2019re constantly weighing up how much morality your career can withstand.\u201d She stresses that performers shouldn\u2019t be put in this position.\n\nThe cumulative trauma of assault and its aftermath forces some women out of the industry. \u201cI\u2019m close friends with someone who had to stop doing comedy for her own mental health due to an assault,\u201d says Spittle. \u201cShe\u2019s one of the funniest people I know and loved comedy so much. It\u2019s so sad.\u201d\n\nSome comedians find the courage to speak publicly and even name those who have assaulted or harassed them, only to face warning letters from legal teams.\n\n\u201cWhat you see on Twitter is only the tip of the iceberg,\u201d Magliano says. \u201cRemember that some people aren\u2019t coming forward \u2013 there are lots who don\u2019t feel safe, maybe haven\u2019t even processed what they\u2019ve gone through, and people who are legally unable to.\u201d\n\nMany are disgusted to see revelations about people they respected, and by the hypocrisy of men they know are sexist making public posts condemning harassment. \u201cPeople you look towards to be allies aren\u2019t necessarily,\u201d Pritchard-McLean says. \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet if people are willing to make themselves uncomfortable. Who wants to believe their friend is a predator?\u201d\n\nSome of those I spoke to expressed concern that ousting a few individuals from comedy would not be enough; there must, instead, be systemic change.\n\nThe suspension of live comedy during the pandemic has allowed for some action. New industry body the Live Comedy Association set up a task force in June to tackle \u201csystemic misconduct\u201d. The group is not currently able to handle individual complaints, but provides a list of resources on its website, is drafting a code of conduct for its members, and is researching how venues, promoters and producers could create policies on sexual harassment.\n\nThere are so many comedians out there, I don\u2019t need to book performers in grey areas Anna Richardson, promoter\n\nPromoters and producers have been discussing concrete ways to make nights safer. The Stand comedy clubs in Glasgow, Edinburgh and Newcastle are among the first to announce new anti-harassment policies. The venues have pledged to never book acts who have behaved inappropriately, and will begin issuing performers and staff with a code of conduct.\n\nAnna Richardson, a producer and promoter who co-runs the London alternative comedy night Permitted Fruit, says it\u2019s \u201cnot rocket science\u201d. If a promoter hears rumours of misconduct on the part of a performer: \u201cYou have to decide what behaviour you think is acceptable, what level of proof you have to have to not book somebody. My opinion is: there are so many comedians out there, I don\u2019t need to book those grey areas. I\u2019m not saying that if you book them, you\u2019re wrong, you just have to take responsibility for your choices.\u201d\n\nThis means mitigating risk with, for example, private changing cubicles, being alert to intimidating behaviour and checking in discreetly with anyone who appears uncomfortable. \u201cBut you should be doing those things anyway,\u201d Richardson says.\n\n\u201cOne member of the team is going to be an HR rep who can deal with things on a case-by-case basis if someone\u2019s got a concern or complaint,\u201d says Martin Willis, founder of production company Objectively Funny. \u201cWe talked about the importance of that person not being the person doing the booking.\u201d\n\nThe company is also planning responses to scenarios including abuse during online shows and allegations emerging about an act it has booked. \u201cWe want to make sure it\u2019s not a knee-jerk response,\u201d Willis says. \u201cThere\u2019s more to supporting people than just barring people.\u201d\n\nComedians including Ruth Hunter and Pritchard-McLean are creating agreements for clubs and promoters to adopt. \u201cI would love for comedy clubs to have a kitemark of safety which says they have sexual harassment protocol,\u201d Pritchard-McLean says. \u201cIf it gets out that they\u2019re not interested in that, don\u2019t think comedians won\u2019t say, and punters will think: \u2018I don\u2019t want to go anywhere comedians don\u2019t feel safe.\u2019\u201d\n\nShe is also planning a mentoring programme, where new women and non-binary acts are paired with established comedians, to try to avoid the kind of abuses of unofficial mentorship experienced by Gilligan and others.\n\nWhile such measures could prevent future misconduct, many performers are living with the trauma of harassment they have already experienced. Magliano is setting up a support group for survivors. She is consulting experts on the best way to run it and wants to create \u201ca safe and confidential space for people to talk \u2026 and know they\u2019re not alone\u201d.\n\nShe says: \u201cI hope talking to each other in a way that allows for open conversation will go some way to starting the healing process.\u201d"}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/aug/05/20-iconic-festival-sets-throbbing-gristle-atp-2004", "published": "2020-08-05T14:31:44", "title": "Throbbing Gristle, ATP 2004: a gateway to a strange other England", "text": "By the winter of 2004, the Pontins holiday camp at Camber Sands had seen better days. Barely updated since its 1970s heyday, the bleak chalets, roamed by the ghosts of Bluecoats, were an appropriate setting for Throbbing Gristle\u2019s comeback.\n\nIn the late 70s, the band had held up a mirror to a seamy, degraded Britain ruled by corrupt authorities and mired in industrial decline, with lyrics about the Moors murders and political control, and stage outfits made of army-surplus gear. Musically, their use of samplers and abstract sound made them pioneers. After they terminated their initial phase of operation in 1981, none of the industrial artists who later cited them as an influence \u2013 Marilyn Manson, Nine Inch Nails \u2013 came close to their radical sonics and social commentary.\n\nTG\u2019s plan had been to return to the fray with their own weekend event at Camber Sands in May 2004, but this was cancelled and that December they joined an All Tomorrow\u2019s Parties lineup, part-curated by the artists Jake and Dinos Chapman. Although a comeback concert earlier that year had been well-received by the faithful, a festival bill featuring Aphex Twin and Sunn O))) could have left a 25-year-old group like TG sounding stale. But this one would be no exercise in nostalgia.\n\nLate on the Friday night, Chris Carter and Peter \u201cSleazy\u201d Christopherson walked on to the stage of the huge upstairs venue, a garish space decorated with murals of cartoon characters and adverts for WKD drinks, its carpet sticky with years of spilled lager. Sleazy was dressed in a giant white furry outfit; Genesis P-Orridge followed in purple tights, tiny skirt, boots and a shock of bleached-blond hair. I had never seen anything like it \u2013 this was not standard at a fairly blokey jeans-and-T-shirts festival. A deep rhythm, pulsing like an anxious human heart, filled the room, Cosey Fanni Tutti used her guitar to make a sound I had never heard the instrument make before and an unearthly growling tickled my ears. The next 90 minutes were life-changing.\n\nThe four musicians on stage were constantly reacting to each other, riding the sound as much as they were generating it through a PA that, rather than being punishingly loud, cushioned and lifted the audience. For every unsettling moment \u2013 such as P-Orridge describing a burns victim over a bleak air-raid siren drone in Hamburger Lady \u2013 Sleazy and Chris Carter\u2019s mastery of sub-bass and Tutti\u2019s pranging electric guitar created a noise that was as ecstatic as it could be discomforting. It was hugely entertaining too, in TG\u2019s own twisted way. P-Orridge roamed the stage gleefully yelling, \u201cWhat a terrible day! What an awful day!\u201d and impersonating two old dears having a strange conversation about shopping over chopped-up jaunty electronics. When P-Orridge slur-crooned their new track Almost Like This as if s/he were a drunken Sinatra, there was even a glimpse of the more traditional Pontins entertainment. It was pure showbiz, mangled pop, sonic attack, caustic wit, deviant rave, naughty, queer.\n\nPerhaps it wasn\u2019t surprising that the performance was so intense. In Cosey Fanni Tutti\u2019s memoir Art Sex Music, she writes of the alleged abuse that Genesis had subjected her to, and the turmoil of TG\u2019s later years. This particular gig was dedicated to Geoff Rushton, (AKA John Balance, Sleazy\u2019s partner in Coil and a dear friend of the group), who had died only a few weeks earlier.\n\nI was so discombobulated afterwards that I ended up wandering Romney Marsh until dawn, listening to Nico on my headphones. TG didn\u2019t just blow my musical imagination wide open. In the 70s, their embrace of direct communication with their fans made them a focal point for the dissemination of underground culture. Although by 2004 we had the internet, an artistic encounter as potent as this sent many of us present off into new directions, discovering not only the musical projects of the various members (Coil, Carter Tutti, Psychic TV) but also worked as a gateway to anything from to techno to musique concr\u00e8te, the occult art of Austin Osman Spare, and way beyond. Throbbing Gristle also modelled how to try and exist without compromise, to be your best and truest self.\n\nIn 2013, I went back to Camber Sands for the final All Tomorrow\u2019s Parties festival. Compared to the radical 2004 event, performances by the same old indie-rock groups \u2013 Shellac, Slint \u2013 seemed conservative and stale. I escaped to nearby Dungeness, where winter sun lit the shingle after a storm. A man dressed as Santa drove his scooter past Derek Jarman\u2019s Prospect Cottage.

I understand there is some controversy surrounding the correct method for making a proper cup of tea.\n\nNo, there isn\u2019t \u2013 tea bag, boiling water, milk. But now scientists think they may have hit on the formula for the perfect cup of tea.\n\nDo they make it in a pot or a mug? They make it in a microwave.\n\nWell, I\u2019ll just be leaving the country now. Relax, these are Chinese scientists.\n\nChinese? What do the Chinese know about making tea? They invented tea.\n\nYou said it was invented by accident! By them.\n\nI\u2019ve had enough of this heresy. The problem, it seems, is that water doesn\u2019t become uniformly heated in a microwave the way it does in a conventional kettle \u2013 there will be cool spots.\n\nThe problem is YOU CAN\u2019T MAKE TEA IN A MICROWAVE. To overcome this difficulty, Chinese researchers developed a special vessel with a silver-plated upper chamber.\n\nMetal in a microwave? That\u2019s not safe! Apparently it is, as long as the metal has a finely tuned geometry. \u201cThe metal edge, which is prone to ignition, is located at weak field strength, where it can completely avoid ignition, so it is still safe,\u201d said Baoqing Zeng, one of the authors of an article published in AIP Advances.\n\nWhy bother with all that? Because the silver acts as a guide for the microwaves, reducing the electric field at the top to inhibit heating, creating a convection process much like the one that occurs in a kettle.\n\nI hope nobody was pulled off vaccine research for this project. Ultimately it is hoped a new sort of container will make good microwave tea possible.\n\nIs this anything to do with that American microwave-hot-tea woman?

Biden promised to select a female running mate, setting up a historic nomination process that many prominent Democratic women say is being overshadowed by the increasingly nasty \u2013 and unmistakably sexist \u2013 debate over who he should choose.\n\n\u201cEven in this moment of women ascending to heights that we never have in our country\u2019s history, it\u2019s still really being talked about and debated through the lens of a man,\u201d said Jess Morales Rocketto, the executive director at Care in Action, a nonprofit group that advocates for domestic workers.\n\nIn the last week, prominent Democratic men, campaign advisors and anonymous donors have suggested that senator Kamala Harris, a top candidate for vice president, was too ambitious and questioned her likability.\n\nThe former Connecticut senator Chris Dodd, a member of Biden\u2019s vice-presidential vetting team, was also reportedly bothered by the lack of contrition Harris expressed over a blistering attack on Biden during an early Democratic debate \u2013 an odd point of caution for a candidate who has been in politics for decades and seen his share of heated fights. Dodd\u2019s younger days as a partier and his history with women have also come into question during the process.\n\nOverall, this year\u2019s vetting period has been cast with a sense of Democratic elders critiquing potential running mates for Biden with the same stereotypical criticisms men too often lob at women.\n\nBiden is reportedly now moving toward the final phase of his selection process. Jill Biden told Fox News on Tuesday that her husband was \u201cclose\u201d to making a decision. An announcement is expected in the coming days.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Biden is expected to name his running mate in the coming weeks, a historic choice that he has said is certain to be a woman. Photograph: Andrew Harnik/AP\n\nHis selection has historic implications. Although two women have previously been nominated for vice-president, there has never been a female vice-president, and an African American woman has never been chosen as the running mate of a presidential nominee from a major US political party. If Biden wins, his pick will be poised as a frontrunner for the nomination for president in the future.\n\nMany Democratic women with extensive experience in party politics say the remarks, while not surprising, are deeply offensive and mar a vetting process that they hoped would be celebrated for its diversity.\n\nLaTosha Brown, the co-founder of Black Voters Matter, said she has been \u201cappalled\u201d by the \u201cracist, sexist tropes\u201d used by party leaders and elected officials to undermine female candidates for vice-president, particularly woman of color.\n\n\u201cBeing a Black woman with ambition is not a problem when it\u2019s in the service of others,\u201d Brown said, adding: \u201cBlack women have always been on the vanguard of fighting for our democracy, and we will continue to do so. But we will also hold accountable anyone who seeks to marginalize our contributions, our intellect or our electability. This is not going to be tolerated.\u201d\n\nBiden reaches out to Latino voters with plan to tackle inequalities Read more\n\nThe best way for Biden to show he condemns these remarks, she said, would be to put a Black woman on the ticket.\n\nThe comments have also exposed a generational divide between an old guard of white, mostly male leaders and a new cohort of diverse, trailblazing women who are increasingly ascendent in the party.\n\n\u201cA new generation has arrived. It\u2019s really interesting this cycle where there\u2019s such an energy and new talent. And I think there\u2019s quite a few past political folks who are trying to find their place in this new political leadership,\u201d said Amanda Renteria, the political director of Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign.\n\nRenteria added: \u201cThey\u2019re just not constructive from a party perspective. But you ask any of those women who have been in an arena. They\u2019re well prepared for that kind of treatment, because they\u2019ve been experiencing it their entire life.\u201d\n\nThroughout Biden\u2019s search there has been familiar scrutiny of potential running mates, such as past comments the California congresswoman Karen Bass has made in praise of Scientology.\n\nStill, Bass has emphasized that she does not \u201cenvision\u201d herself as president, which some viewed as an effort to draw a contrast with Harris. The congresswoman pushed back on the narrative, saying she refuses to be pitted against Harris or any other woman in contention for the vice presidency.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t call me the anti-Kamala,\u201d she said during an interview with The Breakfast Club on Friday.\n\nBass and Harris spoke privately at the memorial service for the congressman John Lewis in Washington last week. \u201cIt was good,\u201d Bass said of their conversation. \u201cShe said \u2018We ain\u2019t doing that.\u2019 It was fine.\u201d\n\nThen there are the observations and critiques that do not usually emerge when men are being vetted, and that are familiar to women in the workplace from the boardroom to the factory floor.\n\nAny woman who has been in office or run before has heard similar comments. They weren\u2019t helpful then, they aren\u2019t helpful now Kathleen Sebelius, former Kansas governor\n\nThe former Pennsylvania governor, Ed Rendell, told CNN that Harris can \u201crub some people the wrong way.\u201d And in an interview with the Washington Post, he said he noticed that the Obama national security adviser Susan Rice\u2019s political stock was rising because she smiled during a TV appearance \u2013 \u201csomething that she doesn\u2019t do all that readily\u201d \u2013 and was \u201cactually somewhat charming\u201d in her television appearances.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to get that. That\u2019s Ed. He has not changed. So you\u2019re going to get those kinds of comments from him,\u201d said Susan Turnbull, a former Maryland Democratic Party chairwoman and former Democratic National Committee vice-chair. \u201cI think that women in particular are looking at this right now, going: \u2018Just stop it. Don\u2019t we have something better to be talking about?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cAm I shocked? No,\u201d Kathleen Sebelius, the former Kansas governor, said. \u201cAny woman who has been in office or run before has heard similar comments along the way. They weren\u2019t helpful then, they aren\u2019t helpful now.\n\nThough the jockeying has intensified in recent days, gender - and the enduring stereotypes of women and power - have shaped the process since the moment Biden eliminated half the population from contention.\n\nEarly on, Stacey Abrams, the 2018 Democratic nominee for governor in Georgia, was chided for publicly campaigning for the role of vice-president. \u201cI would be an excellent running mate,\u201d she told Elle Magazine, unapologetically making the case for her candidacy.\n\nThe Biden campaign has largely declined to engage in the public backbiting. But following the comments about Harris\u2019 ambition, campaign manager Jennifer O\u2019Malley Dillon pushed back. \u201cAmbitious women make history, change the world, and win,\u201d she wrote on twitter.\n\nJen O'Malley Dillon (@jomalleydillon) Ambitious women make history, change the world, and win. Our campaign is full of ambitious women going all out for Joe Biden. He will make this decision, and this is clear: whoever he chooses from the very qualified options to help him win & unite the country, she'll be one too.\n\n\u201cThere are a number of sharp, thoughtful, and, yes, ambitious women up to the task of working alongside him every day to win this race and unite our country,\u201d she added in a fundraising email to supporters this week.\n\nHarris, too, responded during an appearance at the Black Girls Lead 2020 conference.\n\n\u201cThere will be a resistance to your ambition,\u201d she said. \u201cThere will be people who say to you, \u2018You are out of your lane.\u201d\n\nThere is a long history of disparaging women who seek political power as \u201ctoo ambitious\u201d. But many Democratic women have found the suggestion especially galling in light of Biden\u2019s own rise to the vice-presidency.\n\n\u201cThe point of being VP is that you\u2019re next in line to being president,\u201d said Katherine Grainger, a partner at Civitas Public Affairs Group, and a co-founder of the women\u2019s advocacy organization SuperMajority. \u201cIf we just look at Biden, he ran for president in 1988 and ran again in 2008 against Obama, and yet when he was chosen as the VP nobody said he was too ambitious to have that job.\u201d\n\nWhen women run for office, they disrupt a \u201cpatriarchal order\u201d that has helped preserve a male-dominated status quo, Grainger said. Yet she is hopeful that elevating a woman to the vice-presidency could help shatter some of the old stereotypes that continue to constrain female candidates, more than 100 years after women won the right to vote in the United States.\n\n\u201cWomen are constantly walking this tightrope of being the most qualified but also likable or tough; pretty and strong but also team-oriented and compassionate,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat it creates is a structure where you never really see the authenticity of female candidates, because quite frankly they\u2019re not allowed to be themselves.\u201d\n\nFor some, it shows how many sexist barriers still exist in American politics.\n\n\u201cAll over the world, we\u2019ve seen countries elect female leaders and yet for the United States it is still a barrier,\u201d said Donna Brazile, a former Democratic National Committee chair. \u201cIn this country it is still a hurdle for women candidates to be taken seriously, and to be treated as equals when it comes to their qualifications, their experience, and then knowledge of the issues and the political terrain.\u201d\n\nBrazile said the vice-presidential nomination is an opportunity to break \u201ctwo glass ceilings\u201d for women and Black women.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of the progress we\u2019ve made but the progress has been slow,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to hurry history.\u201d"}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/05/meet-david-born-in-france-raised-in-belgium-facing-removal-to-the-drc", "published": "2020-08-05T09:00:26", "title": "Meet David: born in France, raised in Belgium, facing removal to the DRC", "text": "When David (not his real name) walked into the headquarters of the Belgian immigration department to apply for asylum, he looked at the other people in the queue and thought: \u201cThey don\u2019t speak French, they had to flee their country, they have good reason for asking for protection. I\u2019m going to be laughed at.\u201d The officials at the reception desk did not laugh, but they did give him \u201ca weird look\u201d, David says. \u201cWhen they heard my accent and saw my dyed blond hair, they seemed to think: \u2018What are you doing here?\u2019\u201d\n\nDavid recounts that day last year with a flawless Bruxellois accent. Born on the outskirts of Paris to parents of Congolese descent, he arrived in Belgium when still a toddler. We meet close to where he lives, in Brussels\u2019 university district. His outfit \u2013 black ripped skinny jeans, black polo shirt and two white wireless earbuds \u2013 is carefully chosen: David, now 22, is set on a career in fashion.\n\nIn the same month he applied for asylum, January 2019, Belgium received 2,765 applications, mainly from Palestinians, Afghans and Syrians. Why does David, who grew up in Brussels and has never set foot outside the EU, have to seek international protection in what he feels is his home country? Because he is at serious risk of being deported to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a country his parents left when they were children, following their own refugee parents.\n\nQ&A Who are Europe's dreamers? Show Hide Dreamers is the US term collectively given to young people without legal immigration status who were brought to the US as children. Some young people living in Europe without legal status now also call themselves 'dreamers' because their struggle against hostile European migration and asylum policies echoes the US campaign. Between 3.9 and 4.8 million people in Europe are believed to be living without residency permits, about 65% of whom are under 35 years old, according to the Pew Research Center. In the UK, a recent University of Wolverhampton study commissioned by the mayor of London estimated there are 332,000 children and young people living undocumented in the UK, including 106,000 children born in the country. Estimating numbers of undocumented people necessarily involves guesswork \u2013 and the methodologies are often criticised \u2013 but it is thought there are millions of dreamers across Europe.\n\n\n\nDavid\u2019s mother was 17 when he was born. She soon separated from David\u2019s father, who did not recognise David as his son. A few years later she left France for Brussels. The young, single mother entrusted her son to his paternal grandmother. \u201cMy mother wanted to live her life, my father was in jail by then,\u201d David says. \u201cBut I had a happy childhood. I had a lot of cousins, uncles and aunts, I had my friends in school. I didn\u2019t know anything about my immigration issues.\u201d\n\nEstimates suggest between 100,000 and 150,000 undocumented people live in Belgium. No one seems to know how many of them are children, growing up with limited rights. \u201cThey have the right to education,\u201d says Melanie Zonderman from the Platform for Minors in Exile, a network for migrant children\u2019s rights, \u201cand, like undocumented adults, the right to emergency medical services.\u201d That is it.\n\nIn Belgium, as in other European countries, the paths to legal status are confusing and difficult to navigate, let alone for a child. They can apply for a humanitarian permit to stay in Belgium under article 9bis of the Belgian aliens act, but whether this is granted or not depends on opaque criteria, which the Belgian immigration department does not make public. The process can take years, costs \u20ac358 (\u00a3325) for adults (it is free for children), and in the meantime children are at risk of deportation.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Despite having been born in Europe, David is at risk of being deported to the DRC. Photograph: Alessia Capasso\n\nDavid\u2019s situation was complex. His best option seemed to be \u201cfamily reunification\u201d with a parent living legally in the country. But his mother, who suffered from mental illness and addiction, had not kept up her residence permit. His father, who was released from prison when David was about 10 years old, still had not recognised him as his son.\n\nWith David\u2019s 18th birthday approaching, his father finally agreed to a DNA paternity test. When he was 16, David received a five-year permit based on \u201creunification\u201d with his father. Two years later, he was told there had been a mistake: as the child of a refugee, not a Belgian citizen, he was only eligible for a renewable one-year permit, which would become permanent after five years. David felt the blow, but told himself he just had to hold on for a few more years.\n\nThen he did something that blew it all: he came out. \u201cWhen my father got out of prison, he soon realised I was not the son he would have wanted,\u201d David said. \u201cI have always been effeminate. He started making comments: \u2018Why is he like this, why does he dance like a girl?\u2019 And I thought: \u2018I don\u2019t even know you, and you want to change me \u2026 I don\u2019t like this.\u2019\u201d During his adolescence David felt as if he had a split personality: \u201cAt school I was extrovert, sociable and good-humoured, while at home I was silent, almost embittered.\u201d\n\nI was fighting with my dad on the phone, and I just threw it in his face: I'm gay!\n\n\n\nOne day in January 2018, \u201cI was fighting over the phone with my dad, and I just threw it in his face: \u2018By the way, I\u2019m gay!\u2019 He hung up. I started packing my things.\u201d In the following months, David felt relieved. \u201cI started wearing makeup at school,\u201d he says. But then October came, and he had to renew his residence permit. Among the criteria was that David\u2019s father lived with his son and had a stable income. \u201cWhen the official at the city council asked me for my father\u2019s payslip, I realised my situation,\u201d he says. \u201cI told him I wasn\u2019t even talking to my father.\u201d David became undocumented, again.\n\nHe tried applying for a permit under article 9bis, but his pro bono lawyer turned out to be not so pro bono: \u201cHe kept asking me for money.\u201d The lack of transparent criteria also made this route risky. He went to France, his country of birth, to see if he could get papers there, but he was not eligible under French nationality laws.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Selma Benkhelifa, a lawyer and activist, advised David to apply for asylum. Photograph: Beno\u00eet Doppagne/EPA\n\nUntil recently, a lot of families with children were rejected for asylum, says Selma Benkhelifa, a lawyer and activist from the Progress Lawyers Network. \u201cThe minors weren\u2019t even mentioned in these decisions. They were literally treated like part of their parents\u2019 luggage.\u201d So lawyers started filing separate asylum requests for the children, arguing that reintegrating in countries they barely knew, after spending their childhood or adolescence in Belgium, would not only be impossible but would expose them to serious risks.\n\nOn Benkhelifa\u2019s advice, David decided to apply for asylum, based on the persecution he would face in the DRC because of his sexuality. Robin Bronlet, a colleague of Benkhelifa\u2019s, is optimistic about David\u2019s case. But he points out the absurdity of the rule by which children inherit the nationality of their parents. \u201cAs immigration lawyers, we must identify the risks David would be facing in case of \u2018return\u2019 to his \u2018country of origin\u2019, meaning the DRC,\u201d he says, \u201ceven though David was born in Europe and never set foot in Africa.\u201d\n\nThe human side is totally lacking, all they see in you is a sans-papiers David\n\nToday, undocumented children are scattered all over Belgium. Some of them make the news when they suddenly disappear from school, are detained and sometimes deported. But most, like David, keep their worries to themselves and blend in with their classmates, hoping for some miraculous solution.\n\nNone of David\u2019s closest friends from school know he has lost his residence permit and has applied for asylum. \u201cIf I told them, they would worry, and it would be too stressful,\u201d he says, \u201cand I don\u2019t want to be pitied.\u201d Since leaving his grandmother\u2019s house, David has moved around a lot. He stayed with friends and even spent a few nights in a hotel when had nowhere else to go. In September 2019, he moved into a flat with three other gay asylum seekers through Le Refuge, an organisation supporting isolated LGBTQI+ youth.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest While he remains estranged from his father and grandmother, David\u2019s mother has accepted his sexuality.

She spent six months in detention before the coronavirus outbreak forced Belgian authorities to release many immigration detainees. David visited her several times. \u201cTo me, it was an extension of what I had gone through since entering the asylum system,\u201d he says. \u201cThe human side is totally lacking.

It is littered with pop-cultural references: Apocalypse Now, Donkey Kong and the Cure to name just three. And it touches on diversity and disability with a lightness of touch rarely seen on TV. On YouTube, its clips have racked up more than 2.8bn minutes of viewing time.\n\nSo why hasn\u2019t everyone heard of Hey Duggee? Probably because not everyone has a toddler and a TV that is permanently set to CBeebies.\n\nHey Duggee has long been a cult favourite not just for kids but for their mums and dads, too. However, since lockdown, its unique ability to bridge the divide has only become more valuable. The brightly coloured animation is creative, inclusive, joyous and ever so gently educational \u2013 and the ratings reflect that. It has been the most-watched kids\u2019 show on iPlayer during lockdown (67m requests), and reached 1.4 million people as the top-ranking CBeebies show for April, May and June this year. The show has won six Baftas and two international Emmy awards.\n\nFor those who have no idea what Hey Duggee is, let me explain. Each seven-minute episode involves a bunch of animal children (a crocodile, octopus, hippo etc, all confusingly referred to as \u201csquirrels\u201d) spending time with Duggee, a kind of canine scout leader who heads up Squirrel Club. Duggee endeavours to award them a badge at the end of each show, once they\u2019ve been shown the ropes of a particular subject: \u201cWell done, squirrels! You\u2019ve earned your tree badge!\u201d What makes it significantly better than it sounds on paper is the amount of love poured into it \u2013 from the acid-house-inspired music and smart visual gags to the hilarious regional accents of characters such as Chew Chew the Panda (whose sarf-east tones have been compared to those of Adele).\n\nThe Game Show Badge. Photograph: BBC\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s deeply anarchic,\u201d says Alexander Armstrong, who narrates the show. \u201cWhen the squirrels step out of the clubhouse, anything might happen \u2013 they might go on some psychedelic trip up the river to the heart of darkness or they might skip dreamily through waving corn.\u201d\n\nIndeed, there is no set formula for an episode. The Omelette Badge features a Rollerblading ostrich getting lazy chickens back into egg-laying shape; The Theatre Badge opens with an argument between Tino, the artistic mouse, and a chipmunk called Eugene about whether art should challenge or merely entertain; while The Mixtape Badge features nods to Ornette Coleman, Bj\u00f6rk and Orbital (who tweeted: \u201cFinally made it to CBeebies!\u201d). When Boris Johnson called the 2019 general election, Hey Duggee\u2019s The Election Badge was rushed forward to help kids understand the basics of democracy. When my daughter refused to brush her teeth for a year, playing the song from The Toothbrushing Badge \u2013 which features a halitosis-stricken lion called Alain L\u2019Odeur \u2013 was the only way I could get her to sit still.\n\nStudio AKA\u2019s Grant Orchard is the creator of Hey Duggee, and says his two energetic boys were key to the show\u2019s framework: \u201cI was always looking for things to do with them, and so I thought it would be great to have a show that would inform people about how to entertain rambunctious kids.\u201d\n\nWe realised that we had access to the entire BBC music back catalogue, so we really went for it\n\nOrchard, who had worked predominantly in advertising, sketched out his initial idea for the show in 2012: back then it was called Chop Chop and Duggee was Bertie Bowwow, although the gist was the same. Armstrong was brought in at an early stage to narrate, with the idea that his rich tones could create something similar to Lionel Jeffries\u2019 character in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. \u201cThere\u2019s a whiff of Brian Johnston, the great cricket commentator, in there, too,\u201d says Armstrong. \u201cAnd there\u2019s also an inflection of my grandmother there. When she was talking affectionately to her grandchildren, she had a way of making her voice purr slightly; it was so warm and loving you could wrap it around you like a blanket. I really liked the idea of this patrician, faintly military-sounding character having that huge capacity for warmth and affection.\u201d\n\nArmstrong fell in love with the voice he\u2019d landed on, so much so that when there was a bit of pushback regarding whether or not it was the right fit for CBeebies, he said: fine, but they would have to recast it. \u201cThey were lovely, and said: \u2018OK, let\u2019s run with it.\u2019\u201d\n\nMaking Hey Duggee is a highly collaborative experience, says the show\u2019s script editor and writer Jenny Landreth, even if it is ultimately Orchard\u2019s vision. She thinks there\u2019s a misunderstanding about who the show is written for. \u201cPeople have said to me: \u2018It\u2019s clearly a show written for adults that kids also enjoy,\u2019 which is not the case. Our aim is to entertain our young audience. We\u2019re not on some secret mission; nothing is: \u2018Wink, wink, this one\u2019s for the grownups.\u2019\u201d\n\nA lot of Hey Duggee\u2019s magic is down to budget concerns. The simple geometric shapes that make up the characters (the frogs are just triangles with eyes) make animation far swifter. And a lot of the music comes from trawling through sound libraries. (\u201cHalfway through the first series, we realised that we had access to the entire BBC back catalogue, so we really went for it,\u201d Orchard says.) Everyone who works on the show seems extraordinarily committed. Orchard says that some voice actors emerge sweating from the booth after putting their all into voicing the astonishing array of secondary characters in the show.\n\nThe Big Day Out Badge. Photograph: Studio AKA/Studio AKA 2018\n\nSometimes, those characters carry a message: Rochelle in The Making Friends Badge uses a wheelchair, and Mr and Mr Crab are married, although there are no gay rights badges or disability badges. Instead, inclusivity is left as a natural aspect of the show. \u201cIt would be disingenuous to say that we didn\u2019t think about inclusivity, but we didn\u2019t want to be preachy with it,\u201d says Orchard. One of the questions he is most commonly asked is: why, when all the mums and dads arrive with their children at the start of each episode, the crocodile Happy has an elephant for a parent. \u201cMost people get that he\u2019s adopted, but I\u2019m pleased we are posing that question, even if we don\u2019t explicitly answer it on the show,\u201d he says.\n\nOrchard admits he\u2019s been surprised by the show\u2019s success since its launch in 2014, even if his team have been so busy that he\u2019s never had a chance to properly take stock. But he says it was a buzz to see Duggee get its own show at the Design Museum \u2013 a cartoon dog standing proudly among the Anglepoise lamps and Eames lounge chairs. And he was thrilled when his mum \u2013 a voracious reader \u2013 mentioned that a fictional character in one of her books had shoved her kids in front of Hey Duggee. \u201cIt\u2019s getting to be part of the cultural lexicon that I really like. I always hoped that a kid would grow up and remember watching it with their parents.\u201d\n\nNothing could have prepared him for the success of the Stick Song in 2018, though. The gloriously catchy rave tune (\u201cStick stick stick stick sticky sticky stick stick!\u201d) was played on 6 Music and was at one point the subject of a campaign to help it reach Christmas No 1. Evan Davis even used it to play out Newsnight, declaring: \u201cEven if you weren\u2019t in a gravel pit with a big speaker in 1989, we think you\u2019ll like this.\u201d\n\nThe Stick Song\n\n\u201cI was worried that song would be our Bob the Builder moment,\u201d laughs Orchard. \u201cThat it would send people over the edge, and they\u2019d be like: \u2018I can\u2019t take that programme any more.\u2019 Luckily, I think we swerved that.\u201d\n\nIndeed, affection for the song was such that a bunch of metallers even formed a band around it \u2013 recording a blistering cover version and naming themselves Slay Duggee as a result. \u201cYou don\u2019t treat kids like babies,\u201d says the drummer Black Shuck. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to hear Nirvana played on a toy piano. They want to hear Hey Duggee played on a Dean Dimebag spiky guitar with double kick-drum and somebody screaming into a microphone.\u201d\n\nSuch is the crossover love for Hey Duggee that the BBC used a Hey Duggee Stay at Home Badge video as part of its lockdown awareness campaign; a Handwashing Badge video swiftly followed, and garnered 97,000 views in the first 24 hours. Parents grappling with home schooling could turn to Science With Duggee on YouTube, which has now had 12.4m views.\n\n\u201cI think in the middle of all this fear, obfuscation, lack of trust and mixed to poor messaging, Hey Duggee is uncomplicated and feelgood,\u201d says Landreth. \u201cIt\u2019s kind-hearted \u2013 and kindness has felt essential, in life generally, but now especially.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just think it\u2019s a masterpiece, and I\u2019m over the moon that I get to be in it,\u201d says Armstrong, before adding with customary flourish: \u201cWell done, squirrels! You\u2019ve earned your excellent children\u2019s entertainment bay-adge!\u201d\n\nHey Duggee is on BBC iPlayer.

They want you to make the salad dressing.\n\nThat\u2019s because although dressing isn\u2019t complicated, it is a bit of a responsibility, requiring a delicate balance of elements. Decisions have to be made, and your judgment may come into question. At its most basic, a salad dressing comprises three ingredients \u2013 oil, vinegar, salt \u2013 but an old proverb recounted by Marcella Hazan in The Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking holds that the perfect salad needs four people to dress it: \u201cA judicious one for the salt, a prodigal one for the olive oil, a stingy one for the vinegar and a patient one to toss it.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re going to make salad dressing in this time-honoured, high-wire fashion \u2013 right there, on the leaves, in front of everyone \u2013 this is all the recipe you need. Do things in that order \u2013 salt first, then oil, then vinegar \u2013 and be all four people. For the 16 variations that follow, a little more preparation may be required.\n\nJamie Oliver\u2019s basic French dressing adds chopped garlic and mustard to the mix, and offers up an inviolable ratio for successful dressing: three parts oil to one part vinegar. He also unveils a simple technique you can use for all sorts of dressings: put all the ingredients in a jam jar with a tight lid, so you can shake them up just before pouring.\n\nFelicity Cloake\u2019s authoritative vinaigrette employs half a teaspoon of honey as sweetener and binding agent (oil and vinegar separate as soon as you turn your back on them). She also uses the 3:1 oil to vinegar ratio, even though 2:1 is commonly recommended elsewhere \u2013 a blend Cloake dismisses as too acidic.\n\nCitrus shades ... substitute lemon for vinegar and shake up your vinaigrette. Photograph: vanillaechoes/Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nThose are the basics from which endless variations may be spun, with additions, omissions or replacements. You can substitute lemon juice for vinegar, as in this recipe for rocket with a charred lemon dressing, where the lemon is first halved and then charred, cut side-down, in a hot pan. I\u2019m not sure how much difference the charring makes, even after trying it a few times, but surely no harm can come from it.\n\nAromatics all the way ... Anna Jones\u2019s herb salad with a crisp garlic dressing. Photograph: Matt Russell/The Guardian\n\nAnna Jones\u2019s crisp garlic dressing adds chilli and just-browned garlic slices, with lime juice instead of lemon, to top a salad made entirely of herb leaves: coriander, basil, parsley, dill and mint.\n\nIf you\u2019ve got fresh herbs wilting in your fridge, past all use as salad leaves, they can be incorporated into the dressing itself. This tip from Lisa Marie Corso revives tired herbs \u2013 any you\u2019ve got, in whatever combinations you fancy \u2013 by whizzing them up with garlic, oil, lemon, and salt and pepper. The result is a bit like a chimichurri, and can also be employed in that fashion as a sauce for meats.\n\nOpen sesame! Gill Meller\u2019s aubergine, courgette and lettuce salad with tahini dressing. Photograph: Issy Croker/The Guardian\n\nSlightly more exotic, but not much more complicated takes include pomegranate dressing the most difficult aspect of which might be finding a pomegranate. It can be used on green salad, rice salad, couscous or any number of largely interchangeable grains. Gill Meller\u2019s tahini dressing is perfect for a salad of aubergine, courgettes, lettuce and seeds.\n\nAll stirred up ... just add sesame oil and tamari to lemon juice and red chilli to make a delicious dressing for noodles. Photograph: Merethe Svarstad Eeg/Getty Images/EyeEm\n\nThis sesame dressing will work on any sort of noodle salad. It\u2019s a straightforward blend of sesame oil, lemon, chilli and tamari, which is the Japanese version of soy sauce, with a less salty taste and little or no gluten. For the gluten tolerant, soy sauce will suffice. Jane Baxter\u2019s peanut sauce here serves as a dressing for a chicken and cabbage slaw.\n\nRend unto caesar salad a proper, thick emulsion ... Felicity Cloake\u2019s definitive take on a classic. Photograph: Dan Matthews/The Guardian. Food stylist Lo\u00efc Parisot.\n\nThe other main branch of the salad dressing family tree is made up of opaque emulsions, thickened with cream, egg or yoghurt, some of them famous enough to have they own origin stories. Caesar salad, for example, was invented by Caesar Cardini in 1924, allegedly in response to a shortage of supplies at his restaurant. The making of a proper caesar salad is exacting and ritualistic \u2013 it\u2019s supposed to be done by a waiter at the diners\u2019 table \u2013 but the dressing recipe is a good one to have under your belt. Once again, Felicity Cloake\u2019s definitive take is our guide. If you\u2019ve got the dressing right, you can be pretty inauthentic with the rest of the salad without attracting complaint.\n\nAmerican \u201cranch\u201d-style dressing also has its own inventor: plumbing contractor Steve Henson, who first came up with it in Alaska and later served it at the California guest house, Hidden Valley Ranch, he ran with his wife in the 1950s. The dressing \u2013 a mix of mayonnaise, buttermilk, garlic and spices \u2013 proved more popular than the guest house. Technically, authentic ranch dressing is the dried packet version that made Henson rich, or the shelf-stable bottled version that subsequently became wildly popular, but the Greedy Gourmet\u2019s recipe will give you a homemade approximation of that store-bought goodness. Henry Dimbleby\u2019s pink peppercorn dressing is a distant, rather more glamorous relative, using single cream.\n\nGet shredding ... celeriac remoulade. Photograph: YAY Media AS/Alamy\n\nSome dressings are versatile; others are indelibly associated with one kind of salad. Remoulade is, in a way, both: it\u2019s used as a sauce for all kinds of things, including meats, but with salad it\u2019s almost always paired with celeriac. Celeriac remoulade one of my favourite things, and I only ever use this recipe, from Nigel Slater, which I keep on my phone in case I find myself in a part of the world that has celeriac but not the internet. I will not lie to you \u2013 chopping celeriac into tiny uniform sticks is boring and hard \u2013 your hand will be sore when your done. But it\u2019s worth it.\n\nAt the salad boundary ... Thomasina Miers\u2019s sticky roast coronation chicken thighs with a yoghurt dressing. Photograph: Yuki Sugiura/The Guardian. Food styling: Aya Nishimura.\n\nSlater\u2019s Caerphilly salad dressing is more of a winter thing, perfect for bitter, frost-singed chicory, but it\u2019s a rare August that doesn\u2019t feature a few nights cold enough for a heavy salad. Thomasina Miers\u2019 roast coronation chicken thighs may be pushing the definition of salad slightly, but the yoghurt dressing that accompanies it turns it into an ideal summer meal.\n\nFinally, we have that much-derided British staple, salad cream. Before it was a benighted, mass-produced condiment, salad cream was a respectable Victorian dressing. Simon Hopkinson uses his homemade version, made from eggs, tarragon vinegar and whipping cream, to dress a classic high-tea salad. It\u2019s utterly incomparable, especially for me, since I\u2019ve been careful never to try store-bought salad cream in the first place."}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/aug/05/how-the-world-is-coping-with-coronavirus-six-months-on", "published": "2020-08-05T02:00:18", "title": "How the world is coping with coronavirus, six months on \u2013 podcast", "text": "From Portugal to Pakistan, the Guardian\u2019s international correspondent Michael Safi looks at the different ways countries have been affected by the virus and the impact that is having on the lives of people there\n\nIt\u2019s six months since Covid-19 was registered as an urgent threat, and although the panic at the scenarios that filled imaginations in those first weeks \u2013 of millions of imminent deaths, medical systems buckling and food supplies running scarce \u2013 has largely abated, the virus has not.

It\u2019s a movement of Argentinian women who staged a silent protest against the disappearance of their children during the military dictatorships of the 1970s and 80s.\n\nFrom 1977 to about 2006, they gathered at the Plaza de Mayo in Buenos Aires and wore white headscarves embroidered with the names and dates of birth of their children \u2013 demanding answers from the state. It was a bleak form of protest, but it succeeded in getting the generals and police officers prosecuted and punished for crimes against humanity.\n\nLocal law is frozen. An astonishing 99% of habeas corpus pleas since last August are pending\n\nIt\u2019s possible that not so many will be familiar with a markedly similar protest movement, the Association of Parents of Disappeared People (APDP), founded in Kashmir in 1994 by Parveena Ahangar and others whose loved ones have been \u201cdisappeared\u201d. The number of people disappeared in Kashmir since the uprising against Indian rule in the late 1980s is between 8,000 and 10,000. Ahangar\u2019s own son Javaid disappeared in 1990 when he was a teenager.\n\nAhangar and her group gathered in Srinagar, the Kashmiri capital, on the 10th of every month, with headbands bearing blank outlines of passport photos, to memorialise the disappearances and to seek answers. While the protest was often sparsely attended, for years the parents at least had the opportunity to get together publicly: to comfort each other, to demonstrate, to talk to the press. That all changed a year ago today, with an epochal silencing of Kashmiri voices.\n\nOn 5 August 2019, India erased Kashmir\u2019s long-held autonomy by revoking articles 370 and 35A of the constitution (which guaranteed the region\u2019s special status), and put the region under a devastating military and digital siege. These campaigners for the disappeared, mostly women, have themselves disappeared: vanished from our screens, vanished from public memory. This and several other erasures executed by the Indian state over the years, and most categorically in recent months, has led me to believe that Kashmir itself has been subjected to enforced disappearance.\n\nMass arrests, Gestapo-style surveillance, torture, the suppression of free assembly, the crushing of the Kashmiri press as boatloads of Indian journalists and foreign envoys go on guided \u201cnormalcy\u201d tours, the decimation of the local economy, the longest internet shutdown ever imposed by a democracy, the crippling of the education system, the incarceration of thousands of young people, the unprecedented criminalisation of speech (those who\u2019ve been released have had to sign \u201cbonds of silence\u201d), the conversion of hotels and guesthouses into detention centres, the gagging of Kashmir\u2019s civil society. It all serves to remove Kashmiri agency: to keep them firmly out of the frame.\n\nAlready, India is reprogramming the economic and social life of Kashmiris by amending domicile laws, by allowing Indian citizens to acquire property and land, and by abolishing longstanding institutions of the state of Kashmir. Among the bodies disbanded are a children\u2019s commission, a women\u2019s rights body, and the state\u2019s semi-autonomous human rights commission.\n\nThey have made plans to steal Kashmir\u2019s resources. Recently, mining rights to Kashmir\u2019s sand from its riverbeds was given to Indian companies via an online auction that was expressly out of bounds for local families who have depended on the sand for their livelihood for years. India is creating \u201cland banks\u201d for investment opportunities: granting itself powers to procure land for its armed forces just about anywhere in Kashmir. Until recently, it required the consent of the local government, which was last year replaced by an unelected, and unaccountable, Indian governor. Please mark those two words: \u201cland\u201d and \u201cbank\u201d; very potent tools for further exploitation, expropriation and occupation.\n\nKashmir today is being turned into a colony as the world watches. India\u2019s home minister has talked about building settlements and temples. There has been a suspension of even the most nominal form of autonomy. Local law is frozen. An astonishing 99% of habeas corpus pleas since last August are pending. The 70-year-old president of the Kashmir Bar Association, Mian Qayoom, who spent a year in prison, was released on the condition that he can\u2019t go home until a certain date and that he shall not speak. The supreme court of India issued these conditions.\n\nModi's brutal treatment of Kashmir exposes his tactics \u2013 and their flaws | Arundhati Roy Read more\n\nJust before Covid-19 began to spread in February, a high court turned down a petition from another Kashmiri organisation \u2013 unknown to most people, Kashmir has an Association of Pellet Survivors, those blinded by pellet guns introduced in 2012 to quell protests. The court said it was not necessary for them to be heard. An occupation can be identified by just this kind of suspension of everyday legal systems \u2013 a state of perverse and all-pervasive exception.\n\nIndia has embarked on a project to shut out Kashmiris from even a semblance of control over their lives. It was evident on 5 August 2019, when India rushed in thousands of additional troops and cut off Kashmir from the world, and it has been evident since then. In one of the cruellest acts of coercion, the administration now prohibits Kashmiri families from burying their slain militant sons in neighbourhood graveyards. To prevent people from attending the funerals, Indian officials have taken away bodies of militants to remote places for quiet burials. The state has turned body-snatcher.\n\nOne of the ways an oppressive regime exerts control is by dramatising a population\u2019s powerlessness by subjecting it to daily indignities.

Ravindra Gupta and Dami Collier", "text": "Many of us working in NHS hospitals welcomed the news earlier this week that the government had purchased 90-minute Covid-19 tests. Rapid swab tests, called LamPORE, and 5,000 machines, supplied by DnaNudge, will soon be available in adult care settings and laboratories. If they\u2019re effective, they could allow for rapid, on-the-spot testing. But there\u2019s no publicly available data about the accuracy of these tests or how they perform, raising concerns about why the government has endorsed \u2013 and purchased - them.\n\nThe lab-free testing machine from DnaNudge is potentially exciting. The government has placed a \u00a3161m order for these machines, which are currently being evaluated on saliva. If they work, people could be tested for Covid-19 without having to take the nose or throat swab that many find unpleasant. This has particular advantages in children, though it has a low throughput \u2013 each machine can complete only a maximum of 15 tests a day. The developers of the LamPORE swab test say they can complete up to 15,000 tests a day, although no real-world data is publicly available.\n\nDuring the pandemic, the urgency that has produced valuable data has also led to the fast dissemination of research and equipment that isn\u2019t subject to normal systems of evaluation, such as peer review. As clinical researchers, we went looking for information about these two new tests, and could find no data on either, despite the DnaNudge website stating excellent performance in clinical studies. The LamPORE website says that analytical performance testing is \u201congoing\u201d.\n\nLamPORE and DnaNudge are undoubtedly exciting technologies. But the fact the government announcement didn\u2019t even include a \u201cpre-print\u201d publication (the term given to research that is published prior to undergoing peer review) about either test is concerning. According to Imperial College London, DnaNudge was evaluated from April in eight London hospitals.\n\nNobody wants to hinder the development of new, potentially lifesaving technologies. But in order to fully understand how the tests perform in a lab, pre-clinical testing should be rigorous.\n\nCoronavirus '90-minute tests to be provided in care homes and hospitals' Read more\n\nFor a test to be properly validated, a number of conditions need to be satisfied. This takes time. First, a new diagnostic test designed to look for virus genetic material is assessed in the laboratory, using artificially made genetic segments that look like virus. This artificial sample has a set number of copies of genetic material, and it is then diluted down a number of times. Each diluted sample is tested on the device multiple times to see whether it can be detected reproducibly and reliably.\n\nThis experiment provides what\u2019s known as the detection limit of the test, expressed as the number of \u201cvirus\u201d genetic copies in each millilitre of water that can be picked up by the test. The test needs to be run with only water repeated times to check that there are no \u201cfalse positive\u201d results.\n\nPlay Video 0:59 World Health Organisation warns there may no be a Covid-19 'silver bullet' \u2013 video\n\nNext, you take a nose or throat swab from a Covid-19 negative individual and \u201cspike\u201d the sample with some of the artificial genetic material from coronavirus, in order to check that the swab or the secretions that are collected do not interfere with the test. Again, multiple tests are done with varying amounts of genetic material in the \u201cspiked\u201d sample.\n\nThe next step is to access a bank of swabs from patients known to be positive and negative in what\u2019s known as a \u201cgold standard\u201d lab test, such as the tests developed by Public Health England that can quantify the amount of virus present in a person with Covid-19 symptoms. Large numbers of these positive samples, perhaps 50 or more, are tested with the new device. It\u2019s just as important to test a large number of samples from non-Covid individuals to check that no \u201cfalse positives\u201d arise.\n\nThe final step is to test the new device in real time, against a gold-standard test. This step is the most challenging as it sometimes requires ethical approval, and must be done in a clinical environment in real time. When we tested the rapid portable device, Samba II, in Cambridge, we tested it against the standard lab test in 170 patients.\n\nThis required significant regulatory oversight and planning. We showed that Samba II produced results in two hours and was highly accurate compared to the standard lab test, and within three weeks Addenbrooke\u2019s hospital in Cambridgeshire adopted it. And within two weeks of the end of the study, the results of the lab validation and clinical evaluation studies were put online as a pre-print publication for scrutiny.\n\nThe number of new Covid-19 cases across the UK is now relatively low, so obtaining appreciable numbers of positive Covid-19 patients is more difficult for validating new tests. An alternative option would be to validate tests in countries experiencing high infection rates, though this would be time-consuming and complex.\n\nPublic funds have been used to purchase these tests, so transparency about their effectiveness is really important. Recent experience where the government purchased millions of sub-optimal antibody tests before they had been robustly evaluated shows the danger of purchasing equipment on the basis of manufacturers\u2019 claims alone.\n\nWe may be entering an era of trade-offs, where the accuracy of tests is balanced against the number of tests we can achieve. Many see more testing, done in a decentralised fashion, closer to communities and targeting specific at-risks groups, as the best route out of the Covid-19 crisis. In hospitals and care homes, where a single infection can lead to severe consequences in vulnerable people, we need highly accurate tests. In the community, where largely well people need to be tested repeatedly, a compromise between the accuracy, scale and cost of tests can perhaps be reached.\n\n\u2022 Ravindra Gupta is professor of clinical microbiology and honorary consultant physician at Cambridge Institute for Therapeutic Immunology and Infectious Diseases, University of Cambridge.

Pleasingly, it just kind of moved along nicely. This shouldn\u2019t have surprised me; it is a car after all. But after a sorry lifetime of petrol and diesel burning, your hard-wired expectations of electric cars tend to be on the low side. I was initially anxious about how far I could go without recharging, but again my doubts melted away: it said there was 162 miles available before the next charge and I only had 6.8 miles to go. All was well.\n\nBut suddenly a large red warning light flashed up on the dashboard, bearing the legend: \u201cRISK OF ENGINE FAILURE. STOP.\u201d This was disappointing; it had all been going so swimmingly. In my experience, warning lights in cars tend towards ambiguity, merely suggesting something needs attention soon. But there wasn\u2019t a lot of wiggle room with this one. And although we were barely moving, stopping wasn\u2019t an option. To come to a complete halt on this particular road would have resulted in a mention on the traffic news. It would have been interesting to have listened to this but, with my range anxiety yet to be fully assuaged, I didn\u2019t have the radio on lest it drain the battery.\n\nI looked for somewhere to turn off but, for a good mile, there were no opportunities to do so. Furthermore, with the warning light burning redder all the time, the car wouldn\u2019t go faster than almost no miles an hour, eliciting various hand signals from other road users. Finally, I managed a left turn and pulled up in a side street. I called the guy the car had been leased through, who told me to wait while he sought advice from the dealer. After 10 minutes he called back, relaying the dealer\u2019s suggestion that I \u201cturn it off and back on again\u201d. \u201cThey\u2019re just like computers, these things,\u201d he explained. I executed this technical procedure, which I suppose I\u2019ll have to call a reboot. To my delight, the warning disappeared and I was able to complete the remaining few miles of my journey.\n\nMy joy wasn\u2019t unconfined, though. \u201cJust like computers\u201d? How else were these things \u201cjust like computers\u201d? If matters had got really serious, who would have come to the rescue? Someone in overalls with oil on their hands, or a mysterious operative from IT support? Would it crash again, perhaps taking critical data with it? Was someone in an unmarked building in the suburbs of Yekaterinburg behind this nerve-shredding caper on the Euston Road? The questions piled up as surely as the percentage charge showing on the instrument panel ticked down.\n\nSafely home, I then applied myself to the question of where I could charge the car near me. Stupidly, I had done precisely no research on this. I had seen lots of charging points around the place and assumed all you had to do was park up, plug in, swipe your card and Bob\u2019s your uncle. Not so. It\u2019s incredible how complicated everyone has contrived to make it. I was now entering a world of competing apps, tariffs, special cables and so on, all offering charging \u201csolutions\u201d couched in the infantilising language beloved of on-trend startups everywhere.\n\nOne company offers \u201cintelligent\u201d charging as part of its promise to \u201cmake charging simple\u201d. Simple? Really? Another one took the biscuit by \u2013 I kid you not \u2013 actually having its charge point address me directly: \u201cHi, my name is Paul-Ruth. I am an Open Charge POD Point. I can charge 2 x electric cars at once at 7kW.\u201d\n\nIncredulous, I investigated further and came across other nearby charge points called June, Adam, Eddy, Otis, Thor, Luke, Gabe and Dawn. I have resolved to make them all my friends. Paul and I didn\u2019t get off to a great start: he seemed to be in a sulk and delivered no charge at all. Ruth, however, did the business. I\u2019m looking for an address to send her a thank-you card.\n\n\u2022 Adrian Chiles is a Guardian columnist\n\n\n\n"}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/05/collective-caring-spirit-emerged-during-lockdown-covid-19-individual-choice", "published": "2020-08-05T14:17:31", "title": "Can we rekindle the collective, caring spirit that emerged during lockdown?", "text": "I know I\u2019m not the only one who felt it: the change in the air, during those first months of the pandemic. Not the chemical change \u2013 though I\u2019ll remember that too, the teasing freshness of a reduced-transit world \u2013 but the change in energy, the heightened attention: the way we eyed each other on our once-a-day exercise, measuring metres in our mind.\n\nBut it also felt to me like a new carefulness, a deepened understanding of the way our smallest choices hold unseen consequences for others. I lived for months in a state of sensitivity to the rippling consequences of mundane choices, from the ways I situated my body in public spaces to the ways I purchased essential and non-essential goods.\n\nOne visual aid stuck with me from the early days of the pandemic: a single match, taken out of a lineup of burning matches, and so halting the fire. Its simplicity alluded to the bigger picture: my city, this country, the whole world as a grid of matches, laid end-to-end. Every action we take sets off a chain reaction, however small. The pandemic has offered an opportunity to consider our interdependencies more deeply, and to take more care, in turn.\n\nIn her essay \u201cOn Self-Respect\u201d, Joan Didion wrote that those with self-respect \u201cknow the price of things\u201d. In life, this isn\u2019t easy \u2013 everywhere, forces conceal the true cost of our actions \u2013 but during those early pandemic months, it felt like we were collectively trying to learn. A compulsive cynic, I felt in those days a real optimism for what this collective energy could do, if we kindled it. What could a society achieve if it chose to live by a politics of interdependence? What new forms of care could we imagine if we continued to view our individual desires and wellbeing as inextricably bound to the desires and wellbeing of others? What I felt was something I rarely feel, when I take stock of the world as it is: hope.\n\nThat feeling dissipated faster than the clean air. Lockdown ended and concepts like \u201cindividual choice\u201d and \u201cindividual risk tolerance\u201d took its place. The only way I can understand our amnesiac return to this individualistic mindset is that the government has willed it into being with intentionally vague guidance, flipflopping policies, a persistent distrust of the public\u2019s intelligence and overt attempts to shake us out of our collective mindset and back into our dutiful roles as individual market actors.\n\nPerhaps more threatening to the government than a deadly virus was the collective energy in the air, which each day brought new ideas for a caring world held together by something other than transactions. Left unchecked, that energy might have seeded collective demands. The government panicked in the face of impending economic freefall, which \u2013 if met with this energy of collective responsibility \u2013 might threaten the foundation of their cherished free market worldview, like an earthquake levelling a country estate.\n\nThe government now attempts to shake us out of our collective mindset and back into our dutiful roles as individual market actors\n\nGone are calls to \u201cflatten the curve\u201d and \u201cprotect the NHS\u201d. The government has taken a sharp right turn: we are told to \u201ceat out to help out\u201d and go \u201cenjoy summer safely\u201d. These initiatives emphasise personal spending as the most effective way to help our communities, and suggest that holding back, out of caution or care, would be harmful to those around us. Framing collective care as an individual economic choice is, of course, absurd; if your local pub shuts, it won\u2019t be because you didn\u2019t drink enough pints during a pandemic.\n\nDuring lockdown, people understood that we are all only as safe as the most reckless person we came into contact with. Yet, post-lockdown, many have begun to speak in terms of personal choice, personal risk tolerance and personal comfort levels. Acquaintances parrot the fact that young people \u201chardly ever die\u201d from Covid-19: as if that was ever the concern.\n\nIt\u2019s very odd: you cannot both understand the concept of \u201cflattening the curve\u201d and also believe that public health is a matter of personal choice and personal risks. The two are fundamentally incompatible. At the same time, many people, myself included, have been quick to pre-empt any impulse to judge the actions of others: no one wants to police, or be policed by, their family and friends. (That we cannot envision a way of holding each other to higher standards of care without feeling like narcs is, itself, endemic of the pre-pandemic mindset. We now accept others\u2019 decision to party recklessly the way we accepted others\u2019 right to drive gas-guzzling SUVs, pretending individual choice is vacuum-sealed and consequence-free.)\n\nCarrying responsibility for the knock-on effects of our actions is daunting work. Like everyone, I find myself slipping into passive decision-making, eager to shed the weight of calculating harm, and who I\u2019m putting at risk, at any given moment. It is only human to want to lay it down, to pause and momentarily allow those in power set the standard of care. (No doubt, under a more responsible, less sadistic government we might all be feeling less exhausted.) But we have the government we have, and as my birth country, the US, has shown: if you\u2019re waiting for those in power to step up, you\u2019re waiting for your country to burn.\n\nHow, then, can we return to the pandemic\u2019s lesson of interdependence? How can we jettison the language of \u201cindividual risk tolerance\u201d while rekindling our sense of the individual\u2019s responsibility to the collective? How can we sustainably weigh the effects of our choices, without burning out? How can we help each other to remain vigilant against the consequence-blind individualism of the pre-pandemic age? I ask \u201chow can we\u201d because I know the government will not. I ask because I don\u2019t know the answer, except that it may lay in perpetual asking, perpetual calculus.

A country that endears tourists with its effervescent nightlife and scrumptious cuisine is simultaneously the source of constant misery for its inhabitants. And its people spend their years despairing at their beloved homeland, like witnessing a drowning child gasping for air.\n\nTuesday\u2019s devastating explosion is but another on a long list of tragedies to afflict the Lebanese people. A list so long that its beginning is obscure. Where does the pain for Lebanon commence? Is it the 1860s civil war that left more than 10,000 dead? The Great Famine of the first world war that wiped out one third of the Lebanese population? The 1975-1990 civil war that killed 150,000 Lebanese, many of whom are still lying in undiscovered mass graves?\n\nLebanon in mourning after deadly Beirut blasts Read more\n\nLebanon is a tiny mountainous country that produces very little, save for two things: devastation and emigrants. Every Lebanese generation of the past 160 years has suffered trauma, bearing each newborn with the scars of old. And over the same time period, the country\u2019s hopeful have been fleeing the misery besmirching their cherished homeland. More than 10 million people of Lebanese descent live outside the country of 5 million, making Lebanon one of the few nations with the majority of its people abroad.\n\nFor the diaspora, we live a life of exile, driven out by the unfettered rapacity of the few and the havoc they\u2019ve wrought across generations. A paternal forebearer left the devastation of the mid-19th century to the United States in search of opportunity. A century later, my father made the same decision, this time to Australia. My maternal grandmother followed suit after seeing her life all but vanish in the civil war \u2013 her husband killed, leaving her a single mother of seven, one of them my mother.\n\nAlmost every Lebanese family has tales like this. The past doesn\u2019t haunt our present \u2013 it is our present. I returned to Beirut, the only offspring of my migrant family to do so, between 2011 and 2015. My parents thought I was mad to return to the place that had caused them so much pain. Perhaps it was youthful naivety or an arrogant sense of invincibility that thought home in Lebanon was a possibility.\n\nThe apartment I lived in is likely destroyed. The neighbourhoods I knew reduced to rubble. My friends made homeless. Years of work and savings poured into a defiance to make Lebanon work, to make it the home that our parents and grandparents could not, eviscerated. All the physical damage of 15 years of civil war inflicted on Beirutis in a matter of minutes.\n\nI stare at the rubble and dust-covered corpses on videos and recall my parents\u2019 stories of the 1970s. They saw rubble too. I recall their grandparents\u2019 stories of the Great Famine. They saw corpses piled on streets too. And their grandparents stories of the 1860s. The tragedy never ends.\n\nThroughout the long list of tragedies, there\u2019s a common thread that connects the bullet points from Tuesday\u2019s blast all the way back to the 1860s: the culprits, with allegations of widespread corruption at the top. Lebanon is today suffering the worst economic crisis since the Great Famine a century ago. It\u2019s the third most-indebted nation on earth. Its currency has lost 80% of its value this year. Hyperinflation pushed the inflation rate to an insane 90% in June. Half of Lebanon now lives in poverty, and the extreme poor are on the verge of starvation.\n\nWith the currency in free-fall and inflation through the roof, many Lebanese can barely afford basic foods \u2013 most of which is imported. Those imports come through Beirut\u2019s port, the site of Tuesday\u2019s atomic-like blast. To compound the misery of Lebanese, the blasts destroyed crucial wheat silos, edging sections of Lebanon closer to famine. Thousands of homes have been destroyed, including among friends.\n\nCrisis upon crisis: blast rocks a Lebanon already on its knees Read more\n\nThere\u2019s no clear path to how Lebanon can repair the damage. The ruling elite have for months been locked in stalled negotiations with the IMF to access desperately needed loans. The IMF is insisting on reforms that the elite are resisting. But Lebanon doesn\u2019t have the funds to repair destroyed neighbourhoods from the blast, making international aid essential to provide desperate Lebanese with shelter and food. International donors and ordinary Lebanese share the same scepticism, however, of any donor money actually reaching those in need.\n\nThe blast has reignited the rage among Lebanese exhausted by the past year of protests and economic turmoil. WhatsApp groups blending local Lebanese and the diaspora are ablaze with fury amid calls for grassroots action against the country\u2019s leaders. There\u2019s little trust in the government\u2019s ability to lead a transparent investigation to determine the cause of the blast. But for many Lebanese, an investigation isn\u2019t warranted. The negligence in leaving 2,700 tons of ammonium nitrate exposed next to critical infrastructure in the heart of Beirut is the same negligence that has kept Lebanon without essential services such as electricity and garbage collection. It\u2019s simply part of the mould caused by a rotten core that has enveloped every aspect of the country. A rotten core long entrenched in the fabric of Lebanese life.\n\nAnd for those of us abroad, we weep as the generations before us, broken by this seemingly never-ending tragedy.\n\n\u2022 Antoun Issa is a writer and political commentator"}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/05/juan-carlos-spain-immunity-king-graft-fraud", "published": "2020-08-05T12:00:01", "title": "Juan Carlos has fled Spain, but questions over his past will follow him | Giles Tremlett", "text": "For the past century and a half, job security has not been part of the Spanish monarchy\u2019s experience. When former king Juan Carlos announced that he was packing his bags and heading into a form of exile on Monday, he was really following a family tradition.\n\nSpain speculates over whereabouts of scandal-hit ex-king Juan Carlos Read more\n\nNo one would be more aware of that than 82-year-old Juan Carlos himself, who was born in exile and \u2013 reportedly \u2013 in relative impecunity (by royal standards) after his grandfather Alfonso XIII fled the country in the face of popular revolt in 1931.\n\nIt took General Francisco Franco, who came to power with the help of Hitler and Mussolini after turning a failed coup into the Spanish civil war in 1936, to restore the monarchy. But this only came after a vengeful Franco had himself ruled with absolute power, while violently suppressing democrats and making liberal use of death sentences, for almost four decades.\n\nTo secure the restoration, Juan Carlos had first to suck up to Franco, agree that the proper heir to the crown (his own father, Don Juan) should be leapfrogged, and then wait patiently for the dictator to die. When that finally happened in 1975, Juan Carlos received a dictator\u2019s powers \u2013 and refused to criticise his predecessor as head of state.\n\nRemarkably, he gave up that power and steered Spain towards democracy. That has guaranteed him his place in the history books forever \u2013 since the new constitution passed in 1978 still holds, and Spain has prospered as never before.\n\nHis move into exile comes amid investigations into suspected graft and fraud, over a $100m payment to him by the king of Saudi Arabia \u2013 but it also highlights weaknesses that were baked into the original transition into democracy. Given the monarchy\u2019s fragility, and Spain\u2019s fears of another military coup (proven well-founded, when the civil guard lieutenant colonel Antonio Tejero stormed parliament in 1981), huge amounts of energy went into protecting the king from scandal, investigation or unpopularity.\n\nUnfortunately, that energy did not always come from him. He basked in genuine popularity, while living a luxurious life with numerous lovers and constant question marks over how \u2013 given an apparent lack of assets, with royal lands, palaces and art collections actually owned by the state \u2013 he paid for his family\u2019s lifestyle. Those questions, however, were not aired in the press, which acquiesced to an unwritten pact in which the king was left alone.\n\nSince a Spanish monarch is immune to prosecution, there was no question of him breaking the law. Given that he was also spared scrutiny, it is not surprising that he failed to realise that, if Spaniards ever found out about some of his activities, many would disapprove.\n\nHe also got careless. A first major gaffe saw him have to be evacuated home after an accident during a secret (and expensive) 2012 elephant hunt in Botswana, while the rest of Spain hunkered down to survive the financial crisis. That helped bring about his abdication, in 2014. The second, in which vast sums of money gifted by Saudi Arabia and others were left sloshing around accounts in Switzerland \u2013 accounts eventually closed down by the banks themselves \u2013 has now brought his exile.\n\nMore worrying than the alleged individual sins of a monarch, which are yet unproven in court, are the lengths to which parts of the Spanish establishment have gone to protect him. It is possible that some of his most ardent friends and advisers were attracted to the king\u2019s opaque financial arrangements. Others appear to think that to protect an individual king is to protect the monarchy \u2013 which is the exact opposite of what has happened.\n\nPerhaps the former king\u2019s friends and collaborators, who tended to lash out at those who made accusations against him, were merely protecting themselves. Either way, they are now throwing Juan Carlos under the bus in order to protect his son, the current monarch Felipe VI.\n\nSpain\u2019s state pollster CIS stopped measuring the popularity of the monarchy five years ago, after it dipped into negative figures. As a result, this is done instead by the press and the pollster of the separatist-led Catalan regional government. The numbers continue to show overall disapproval.\n\nIf Spaniards deserve one thing, it is transparency. Their constitution allows them to sack the monarchy, in the unlikely event that a significant majority so desire.\n\nThey can make no call on that, however, while Spain\u2019s establishment continues to believe that the monarchy\u2019s weaknesses must be hidden, rather than exposed to the light \u2013 so that they can be worked on and, if possible, improved.\n\nNow, at least, courts around the world are free to investigate. Juan Carlos\u2019s financial affairs are already being studied in Switzerland and in Spain. Exile won\u2019t make any of that go away.\n\n\u2022 Giles Tremlett is a correspondent based in Spain.

We are now entering the required 30-day consultation period on these proposals.\n\n\u201cWe know this is upsetting and difficult for our dedicated staff and our focus is on managing this as sensitively as possible. These proposed changes are ultimately about ensuring we take this great football club forward, creating the right organisation for a post-Covid world, and ensuring we have the resources to return to competing effectively at the top of the game here and in Europe.\u201d\n\nIn April Arsenal, who finished eighth in the Premier League, agreed a 12.5% pay cut over the next 12 months with most of their men\u2019s first-team squad and all the coaching staff.

Arsenal\u2019s wage bill in their most recently published accounts, for 2018-19, was \u00a3232m.\n\nThe club continued to pay staff in full during football\u2019s lockdown instead of falling back on the government\u2019s taxpayer-funded furlough scheme.

That is a truncated summary of the instructions passed between Ray Lewington and Tyrick Mitchell during Crystal Palace\u2019s final match of the season, a 1-1 draw with Tottenham.\n\nMitchell is a graduate of the Palace academy and the Spurs match was his fourth senior appearance. Lewington has been coaching for 34 years. Part of his job is to pass his expertise on to players, to help them learn. Thanks to the particular conditions imposed on the restart of football, however, Lewington was able to coach in a new way; live, unrelenting, in Mitchell\u2019s ear like a podcast that was impossible to switch off.\n\nOff for a cough? FA outlines new rules for players that splutter at opponents Read more\n\nRestart football has had its critics, and the reasons are understandable. There was a sense of ghoulishness about playing on in a pandemic, something reinforced by echoes bouncing around empty stadiums. It was only being done for money and it was achieved without supporters, who were contained within a video wall, released only when it was time to shake a fist or collapse their heads into their hands.\n\nThere were good bits to restart football too, though. There were things that made it different and which offered fans, well viewers, the chance to experience something new. As the 2020-21 season approaches, with a push to get things back to normal, these innovations seem likely to disappear. That will be a shame.\n\nMitchell had a stormer against Spurs, earning a post-match backslap from Jos\u00e9 Mourinho. Watching Lewington coach him through the game and seeing the youngster absorb information and respond was fascinating. In that same game, because Palace were pumped up to put an end to a seven-match losing streak and Spurs were on the verge of qualifying for Europe, there was also a cacophony of noise provided by the players as they sought to keep each other on their toes.\n\nThat intensity would normally be provided by fans, of course, and the only reason you could hear what was said on the pitch was because fans were not there. So as a trade-off it was not ideal. But sitting in the ground reporting it provided an insight I do not normally get and, by switching off the fake crowd noise, the viewer could pick it up at home, too.\n\nOther changes were deliberate, rules devised to suit the particular nature of the restart. The use of five substitutes, from a bench of nine, is one. Designed to help prevent burnout during a compacted calendar, it has been the subject of much scrutiny and some thoughtful analysis. Does it benefit big clubs with deeper resources, or actually help smaller teams for whom the gap between a first XI and its reserves is less steep?\n\nWhatever the answer, as a viewer, five subs makes for a more interesting, intriguing experience. Quite simply it offers a greater number of variations in a game. Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r embraced the new rule by making changes; the first coach in England to introduce five substitutes and, in extra time in the FA Cup at Norwich in June, the first to make six.\n\nAgainst Spurs in his first game back he used four subs to change the personnel and shape into something more attacking as United tried to come back from a goal down. Once Bruno Fernandes had scored the equalising penalty, the final change was used to hoik Scott McTominay out of a makeshift backline and replace him with an actual defender.\n\nAnother change was the drinks break. Brought in to help players stay hydrated during summer matches, it looks likely to be given the chop for next season. It has again been criticised, both as an unnecessary interruption and an advertising break by stealth. It is inarguably a tactical break, something which some people do not like either. But watching the FA Cup final it was hard to argue that the story of the game was not improved by Mikel Arteta using a drinks break to counter Chelsea\u2019s blitz of a start by telling Kieran Tierney to send the ball long, beyond the opponent\u2019s high line, wherever possible.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nJust for the sake of balance, Frank Lampard used the break to good effect as he switched tactics in the second half against Manchester City at Stamford Bridge in June. By holding off a City onslaught and sneaking a win (again through a more direct approach against an advancing opponent), he earned points that effectively got his team into the Champions League. Another twist.\n\nSilence, subs, drinks breaks make for a richer viewing experience. And viewing is what restart football is about. You could not go to a game as a fan but, for a glorious six-week spell, it felt as if there was always a match lurking somewhere on your phone. For the next month there will be a similar, slightly thinner experience as Uefa plays out the remainder of its competitions in what BT Sport is ill-advisedly calling Club 2020.\n\nRestart football is only available through your TV but, by and large, it was not designed for it. As all the canvas seat covers around the grounds reminded us, it was trying to get as close to normal football as the circumstances allowed. By accident it ended up showing the potential for a new kind of product that goes by the same name. \u201cViewers\u201d, \u201cproducts\u201d \u2013 terminology loathed by fans trying to keep the flames of longstanding tradition alive. But on screen not in person lies the future of elite football, pandemic or not. The restart offered a glimpse of what might be possible."}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/aug/05/joe-bryan-seizes-the-moment-to-grab-glory-and-crush-brentford-spirit", "published": "2020-08-04T23:08:26", "title": "Joe Bryan seizes the moment to grab glory and crush Brentford spirit | Jonathan Liew", "text": "The pragmatism of Scott Parker\u2019s Fulham triumphed over the doomed idealism of Thomas Frank\u2019s Brentford in a game that failed to live up to the billing\n\nAnd so, ultimately, it all came down to this. A full year of toil; 120 minutes of grim application, in many cases a lifetime of longing. A free-kick in a seemingly innocuous position on the left wing. A defence maintaining an audaciously high line, a goalkeeper anxiously patrolling the space behind it and a left-back who spied an irresistible opportunity to write himself into folklore.\n\nThat, ultimately, was all it took to send Fulham back to the Premier League and leave Brentford in the Championship for another season. On one level, it felt unspeakably senseless for something this important to be settled by something this silly. But then again, here we all were, watching a terrible game at an empty Wembley Stadium in August, with fake crowd noise being piped over the airwaves and a socially-distanced national anthem at the start.

And yet, even if they were the more assured team on the night, right down to Joe Bryan\u2019s premeditated slice of opportunism, you\u2019d be hard pushed to describe them as deserving winners: a term which implies a semblance of logic, of rational process, above all of proportionality. And really, very little about this fixture has ever really been proportional, from its ridiculous importance to the way people talk about it.\n\nThe Championship play-off final is often described \u2013 with football\u2019s characteristic vulgarity \u2013 in terms of its pecuniary reward. \u201cThe richest game in football\u201d. \u201cThe \u00a3170m game\u201d. As if the money were in a glass box suspended above the pitch, like in a TV game show. As if, as the full-time whistle blew, the winners would be showered in a typhoon of flying banknotes and embraced by a beaming Davina McCall. As if the ultimate objective of football were three seasons of guaranteed parachute payments.\n\nIt\u2019s a cool story, but the real motif of this fixture is status. About where you are and where you need to be. As good as the Championship is as a competition, as a dream factory, as an entertainment product in its own right, it\u2019s the pinnacle of nothing. Being in the Championship is a bit like being the leader of the opposition: if it\u2019s all you\u2019ve achieved, then on some elemental level you\u2019ve fallen short of expectations.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Scott Parker celebrates with double goalscorer Joe Bryan after Fulham\u2019s victory had secured their immediate return to the Premier League. Photograph: Mike Egerton/PA\n\nFor young players like Josh Dasilva, released by Arsenal two years ago, it was about fulfilling the promise that first opened the doors to this world. For those like Bryan who have toppled from the pedestal, it\u2019s about proving to the sport, but mostly to yourself, that you can still pass muster at the highest level. Nine of Fulham\u2019s starting XI had previous Premier League experience. Brentford\u2019s entire squad had a grand total of two appearances.\n\nAnd so perhaps a good way of thinking about this taut, undulating game was as pure hunger against pure desperation, the doomed idealism of Thomas Frank\u2019s Brentford against the cussed and ultimately triumphant pragmatism of Scott Parker\u2019s Fulham.\n\nScott Parker warns against 'drastic changes' after Fulham's play-off win Read more\n\nFulham may not have won too many points for artistic merit this season but here we discovered why. With Aleksandar Mitrovic unable to start because of a hamstring problem, they looked secure without ever looking like they knew how they were going to break Brentford down. The full-backs largely pulled their punches. The midfield sat tight and narrow, seeking to recycle possession rather than risk losing it. Centre-halves Tim Ream and Michael Hector exchanged more passes than anyone on the pitch. It was a bespoke system for a bespoke game.\n\nBrentford, on the other hand, have a philosophy. They have a \u201cway\u201d. They have combinations, overloads, transitions, a meticulously drilled attacking game that somehow still feels fresh and full of personality.\n\nThey have a hip manager in Frank who whips out a miniature tactics board during the drinks breaks, which seems to disproportionately aggravate a certain kind of person, who will instantly start spuming at the mouth at the sheer metropolitan pretension of it all. I mean, what does he think this is, football?\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nAnd yet, as Bryan finally buried Brentford\u2019s hopes with his second goal deep into injury time, you could see the lack of comprehension on the faces of their players and staff. What good is a process in a game when only the result matters? What good is a philosophy in a sport where everything can turn on a freak goal from a set piece? How do you take pride in a season that has ended so crushingly?\n\nBut then, this has always been the irresistible caprice of football, a low-scoring game that for all your plans and strategems can never entirely be bent to your will. Fulham\u2019s triumph was to turn it into a battle of errors and individual flourish. As the whistle blew, there was no glass box, no banknotes, no Davina McCall. Just a winner and a loser, and a pitiless line between them."}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/aug/05/ze-maria-brazil-parma-inter-kenya-ancelotti-adriano-ronaldo-romario-mancini-mourinho", "published": "2020-08-05T10:05:29", "title": "Around the world with Z\u00e9 Maria: from Brazil to Parma, Inter, Kenya and back", "text": "Z\u00e9 Maria has some stories to tell. So many, in fact, that it takes three video calls over two days (and a lot of patience on his part) to even scratch the surface. Over the last 30 years, he has been from the bottom of world football to the top and back again, stopping on every step in between and at quite a few places around the edges.\n\nThere are tales from his playing days: memories of Carlo Ancelotti, Fabio Cannavaro and Lilian Thuram at Parma; recollections of Roberto Mancini, Adriano and Lu\u00eds Figo at Inter; stories of M\u00e1rio Zagallo, Ronaldo and Rom\u00e1rio Romario with Brazil. Then there are the times spent as a manager in Kenya, in a remote Romanian ski resort and the Albanian second tier. There are thoughts on the current state of football and on the barriers he faces as a black coach trying to take his career to the next level.\n\nAs our conversation jumps from country to country, subject to subject and through different eras, he goes back to the same themes of relationships, trust and the power of persuasion. More than once, he brings up his favourite quote from Bernardinho, a Brazilian volleyball coach so successful his house contains more precious metal than most central banks: \u201cA great coach is one who can make a player willingly do that which he normally would not.\u201d\n\nFor Z\u00e9 Maria, that coach was Ancelotti, who he calls his \u201cbiggest influence\u201d and \u201cone of the three best managers in the world\u201d. Ancelotti was the promising young Parma boss when Z\u00e9 Maria moved there from Flamengo in 1996. \u201cI was approached by Barcelona and Real Madrid, but I turned them down,\u201d he says. \u201cMy dream was to play at a big club in Italy. In Brazil, we only saw the Italian league.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Z\u00e9 Maria tussles with Ronaldo while the pair played in Italy, for Parma and Inter, respectively. Photograph: Reuters Photographer/Reuters\n\nIt was not without its challenges. \u201cSerie A is the most difficult league in the world. You leave Brazil, you have zero tactical knowledge and you go to a country where it\u2019s all tactics? It\u2019s complicated. As a full-back I liked to attack and attack. I had to learn how to defend, to cover the centre-backs.\u201d\n\nAncelotti helped him adapt, by demanding hard work but also being warm and encouraging. \u201cHe treats you as a person first, then as a player. All managers should do that. The group at Parma was terribly strong. The defensive line was me, Buffon, Cannavaro, Thuram and Benarrivo. In front of us Sensini, Dino Baggio and then Chiesa and Crespo up front. There were players on the bench who had won the World Cup in 1990 and finished as runners-up in 1994. [Ancelotti] knew how to manage that. That\u2019s the difference with great coaches.\u201d\n\nAncelotti led Parma to second place in Serie A that season after being in the relegation zone at Christmas and, Z\u00e9 Maria says, the relationship they built \u2013 \u201ca bond of friendship but always respecting the limits between manager and player\u201d \u2013 survives now. He spent a week watching Ancelotti work at Napoli in 2019 and follows his progress at Everton.\n\nSandro: 'It was a privilege to play for Spurs. Leaving is my biggest regret' Read more\n\nAfter finishing as a runner-up in 1997, Z\u00e9 Maria had to wait nine years before he finally won a Scudetto while playing for Inter. In another stellar squad, with another young, ambitious Italian manager in the shape of Mancini, Inter also won the Coppa Italia twice in both of his two years in Milan.\n\nMancini also knew how to tread that line between disciplinarian and ally, says Z\u00e9 Maria, especially when it came to that team\u2019s great talent, Adriano. \u201cThere are players that you know haven\u2019t slept [before training], but you need them. The coach walks past and sees the guy lying there, but he turns his head the other way. You can\u2019t let it go all the time. With players of that quality [on the bench], it could create problems. That\u2019s what Mancini knew how to do. He knew when to turn his head. The players think: \u2018Fine. Leave him. On Sunday he\u2019ll score, we\u2019ll win the game, we\u2019ll win a cup or the league.\u2019 It happens at all big clubs. The coach needs to be intelligent.\u201d\n\nJust how good was Adriano? \u201cI had to mark him when he was at Inter and I was at Perugia. I remember a game when our centre-back tried to haul him down by the neck and Adriano dragged the guy along for 10 metres, broke away and scored. He was intelligent too, so he was unmarkable. Unfortunately, when his father died, he had a lot of problems in his head. Even when you\u2019re close friends, it\u2019s difficult for you to hold back a guy who is 1.90m tall, weighs 90kg, who wants to go out and live his life. Unfortunately, he ended up losing a little of what he could have given.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Z\u00e9 Maria playing for Perugia. Photograph: Panoramic/Panoramic/PA Images\n\nIn Brazil, the media coverage of Adriano\u2019s personal life is intense and often sneering, even a decade after he last played for the national team. \u201cThere is a passage in the bible; \u2018A prophet is not without honour, except in his own land.\u2019\u201d Z\u00e9 Maria says. \u201cIn their own country people are intensely criticised. Adriano\u2019s problem, if it is a problem, is that he is a fantastic boy with a huge heart. People criticise him for that. People want him to be something else.\u201d\n\nAs well as that silverware in Italy, Z\u00e9 Maria won a Confederations Cup and Copa Am\u00e9rica with Brazil in 1997, in a squad he describes as \u201cone of the greatest in the history of the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o.\u201d It is a bold claim, but one that bears up to scrutiny. Brazil played 24 times in 1997 and scored 71 goals \u2013 three per game. A front two of Ronaldo and Rom\u00e1rio cut through defences like woodchipper through candy floss and they were more than ably supported.\n\n\u201cThere were 23 of us and anyone could play,\u201d says Z\u00e9 Maria. \u201cSometimes it would be me and Z\u00e9 Roberto [at full-back], other times it was Cafu and Roberto Carlos. Up top you had Rivaldo, Rom\u00e1rio, Bebeto, S\u00e1vio, Ronaldo, Djalminha, Juninho.\u201d Managing the group was not without its issues. \u201cIt was as difficult to mark those guys off the pitch as it was to mark them on it. There were the devils and the angels. It was mostly the guys from Rio who liked to go out. Rom\u00e1rio, Paulo Nunes, Djalminha, Ronaldo, Edmundo. Then there was a group that was a bit calmer, the ones who played in S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\n\u201cEveryone had their own temperament, but there were never any clashes. Zagallo knew how to control it, giving a bit of freedom at the right time, controlling things at other times. Even with Rom\u00e1rio, there are times that you can go out, and times you can\u2019t. They ended up having a few arguments. But up until 1997, Rom\u00e1rio was always in the squad. He only didn\u2019t go to the World Cup because he was injured.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Z\u00e9 Maria celebrates after scoring for Inter in 2005. Photograph: Reuters Photographer/Reuters\n\nThe same fate befell Z\u00e9 Maria. He picked up a knee injury at the Gold Cup in February 1998 \u2013 not helped by the fact that Zagallo played him while unfit. There had been talk that he, not Cafu, would be the first-choice right back in France \u2013 \u201cI was one of the few players who really pushed him for that position,\u201d he says \u2013 but it was not to be.\n\nFor Japan and Korea four years later, he says he \u201cdid not expect to be called up\u201d. He had played for Luiz Felipe Scolari at Palmeiras and the pair had fallen out over what Z\u00e9 Maria saw as dishonesty from the coach. \u201cHe wanted me on loan. I didn\u2019t want to sit on the bench, so I asked him to guarantee that I would dispute the position fairly with [Francisco] Arce. But when I got to Palmeiras, I was a substitute. Even when I played well, I\u2019d be on the bench the next game. We ended up having problems. Because of that I always say in my teams the player in the best form will play. Nobody has a fixed place in my teams.\u201d\n\nHis teams? We\u2019re off in another direction now. In 2010, Z\u00e9 Maria completed his Uefa Pro Licence at Coverciano, the revered Italian managerial finishing school that trained his mentors Ancelotti and Mancini. \u201cYou study various subjects \u2013 English, sports medicine, physical training, technique and tactics \u2013 and two that really caught my attention: psychology and communication.\u201d\n\nAs part of that process, he shadowed Jos\u00e9 Mourinho during Inter\u2019s treble-winning season. \u201cHe\u2019s like a Brazilian coach in that he talks to the players a lot. You had Eto\u2019o, Sneijder and Milito, who weren\u2019t used to defending. You go back to Bernadinho\u2019s comments. Because Mourinho is a great leader, they would do anything for him. Materazzi is not an easy person to work with, but if Mourinho told him to jump off the 30th floor, he\u2019d jump. [Mourinho] would tell Balotelli to shut his mouth, that if Balotelli didn\u2019t do what he was told, he could go home. It\u2019s another way of managing.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Z\u00e9 Maria shadowed Jos\u00e9 Mourinho during the 2009-10 season, when Inter won the treble. Photograph: Kai Pfaffenbach/Reuters\n\nZ\u00e9 Maria has subsequently taken charge of six clubs in five countries, moving from Italy to Romania, Kenya and Albania before returning to Brazil. \u201cI\u2019ve worked in some exotic places,\u201d he chuckles. In Romania, he lived in the Carpathian Mountains, managing a club called Ceahlaul. \u201cPrince Charles has a house up there, where he goes skiing from time to time,\u201d Z\u00e9 Maria smiles. \u201cIn the winter it was -16\u2103. When you\u2019re giving a training session, first your fingers and toes start to freeze, then the whole of the rest of your body. There was a ski lift in the middle of the town, but there was nothing else. My office overlooked the cemetery.\u201d\n\nKenya was a jarring contrast. \u201cI arrived in Nairobi and, when I got off the plane, I almost caught fire. The sun burns on your skin. I walked down the road and there were zebras on the other side. I was having lunch next to Lake Victoria and a guy came over and said: \u2018Careful if you see any waves here, because it might be a hippopotamus.\u2019 People wondered what I was doing there. \u2018Z\u00e9 Maria who played for Brazil and Inter?\u2019 They wanted to touch me. People wanted to hear my stories. It was the biggest club in Kenya, so every game was like managing Flamengo or Corinthians in Brazil. The stadium was packed.\n\nLuiz Felipe Scolari: 'Everything I did as a manager, I learned as a teacher' Read more\n\n\u201cThere were difficulties. Sometimes you go to a stadium where the players don\u2019t all fit in the changing room, so you have to change on the bus. But the passion is absurd. African players are technically similar to Brazilians, but they lack opportunities to move to bigger leagues. Because of the pitches, when you dribbled the ball would bounce a metre up in the air, but the quality with which they controlled and conducted it, not even a Brazilian would do that.\n\n\u201cI worked in Albania at KF Tirana, the biggest club in the country that had been relegated to the second division. They had never been relegated before and had real problems. But we won the second division and the Supercup.\u201d Most recently, he spent time coaching Portuguesa in S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\nZ\u00e9 Maria sits back and ponders what will come next. He would consider taking a job in Brazil but, after spent 23 years outside the country, he is viewed with suspicion. In Brazil, there is a small circle of managers who always get the big jobs. In Europe, meanwhile, there is little space in the dugouts for Brazilians. \u201cThere are no Brazilian coaches in the top four leagues in the world. There are two reasons. Firstly, they [lack] desire to go to Europe and get up to the [tactical] level of the European coach. Secondly, it\u2019s difficult to leave Brazil. It\u2019s winter here and it\u2019s 30\u2103.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard Muricy Ramalho, a great coach, saying: \u2018I\u2019m Brazilian, we have to dribble, we can\u2019t lose that.\u2019 But you\u2019re not going to lose that. You can dribble, but with organisation behind it. Those are the things Brazilians don\u2019t want to do, to get out of that comfort zone, to grow. That\u2019s what we have to learn. The Argentinians do that. Pochettino, Simeone. It\u2019s arrogant to think that you don\u2019t need to improve.\u201d\n\nRace is also an issue. In Brazil, where people of colour make up more than half the population, just one of the 20 managers in the top flight is black. The situation is just as bad in Europe. \u201cLook at the big teams in the world; there are no black coaches. What\u2019s happening [with the Black Lives Matter movement] is good, but it\u2019s unlikely there will be a radical change. The storm will pass and everything will go back to how it was. People aren\u2019t going to stop being racist.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Z\u00e9 Maria in action for Inter in 2005. Photograph: Paco Serinelli/AFP/Getty Images\n\nHis race also held him back as a player. \u201cI was going to move to Verona but I didn\u2019t go because the fans thought there should not be a black player in their team. I\u2019ve been to cities where I was booed, along with other players of colour, like Thuram. When it happened, I responded by dedicating myself even more. That was my way of showing up their stupidity. They harmed their own clubs. They lost on the pitch and were fined off it. But in the following game the same thing happened again. That\u2019s why I say it\u2019s unlikely that it\u2019ll change. It\u2019s sad that people don\u2019t learn.\u201d\n\nZico: 'I would not swap watching the Premier League for any other' Read more\n\n\u201cWe need a 180-degree turn and that requires courage. It requires courage from club presidents and the people in charge. When a coach of colour takes over at a big club, he has to be the best, otherwise he will be fired quickly. We\u2019re not asking for much. I just want the same amount of time a white manager would have. If the opportunity comes for me to coach a big club in Brazil or Europe, I am qualified to do it well.\u201d\n\nHe dreams of coaching in England, where he spent a week towards the end of his career, training under Bryan Robson at Sheffield United. A deal did not go through but it left an impression. \u201cEnglish people like beer but, even if they have a few beers after training, during training they dedicate themselves 100%. That\u2019s the mentality I like. On the pitch, I want to give my maximum, I want to get better, I want to win. I saw a guy go in head-first into a tackle in training.\n\n\u201cIt would be easier for me in Italy, because of the language. But, thinking about how I want to work, with intensity from morning until evening, England is the place. I demanded a lot from myself as a player \u2013 I stayed after training to practice crossing, passing and shooting \u2013 and that\u2019s what I demand from my players: dedication and desire to win.\u201d\n\n\u2022 This is an article from Yellow & Green Football\n\n\u2022 Follow them on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter\n\n\u2022 And follow Joshua Law on Twitter"}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/aug/05/footballers-who-have-had-club-shirts-retired-having-played-very-few-games", "published": "2020-08-05T09:00:26", "title": "The Knowledge | Footballers who have had club shirts retired having played very few games", "text": "\u201cBirmingham took the unusual step of retiring Jude Bellingham\u2019s No 22 shirt after the teenage prodigy secured a move to Borussia Dortmund. What other clubs have retired shirt numbers in honour of players? And, if there are others, are Bellingham\u2019s 44 appearances a record low for the bestowing of this honour?\u201d asks Derek Robertson.\n\nWe covered Derek\u2019s first question back in 2009, with Franco Baresi, Paolo Maldini and Bobby Moore among the legends whose shirt numbers were retired. There have been plenty of examples of a shirt number being retired in honour of a younger player \u2013 most, sadly, in more sombre circumstances than Jude Bellingham\u2019s.\n\n\u201cQPR retired the No 31 shirt in memory of Ray Jones,\u201d writes Edar Mullan. \u201cThe promising young striker had scored six goals in 37 appearances for the Rs before he died in a car crash in 2007, three days short of his 19th birthday.\n\nThe list of players whose shirt number was retired posthumously is tragically long. Those who made fewer than Bellingham\u2019s 44 appearances include Marc-Vivien Fo\u00e9 (Manchester City, No 23, 38 appearances), Michael Maidens (Hartlepool, No 25, 31 apps), Mark Philo (Wycombe, No 14, 17 appearances), Cheick Tiot\u00e9 (Beijing Enterprises, No 24, 11 appearances) and Dylan Tombides (West Ham, No 38, one appearance).\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A Manchester City fan\u2019s tribute to Marc-Vivien Foe hangs outside Maine Road in 2003. Photograph: Howard Walker/Reuters\n\nOf those whose shirt number was retired while they were still alive, one man stands out: Austrian journeyman and cult figure Stefan Maierhofer. \u201cThe tall striker is not the most gifted footballer, but is rather known for his work ethic and his incredible self-esteem,\u201d says Michael Gahler. \u201cIn November 2014 he joined SC Wiener Neustadt on a short-term deal until the end of the season. He had the option to terminate the contract if a foreign club came in for him during the January transfer window, and he joined Millwall for a second time after less than two months with Weiner Neustadt.\n\n\u201cHe had worn No 39 while at the club (it wasn\u2019t his regular shirt number \u2013 I guess he just took some random number that was not occupied since he joined in the middle of the season), and when he left the club decided to retire his shirt number. \u2018As a motivator he influenced the team with his positive energy during a difficult spell, they explained, \u2018and he helped SC Wiener Neustadt to gain previously unknown public perception.\u2019\n\n\u201cSadly his time at the club didn\u2019t help them avoid relegation from the Austrian Bundesliga. They haven\u2019t returned to the top flight since.\u201d\n\nThe longest unbeaten home runs\n\n\u201cLiverpool have gone three straight league seasons without a home defeat. What\u2019s the record (English, European, worldwide)?\u201d wonders Boris Cule.\n\nAs great as Liverpool have been at Anfield in the last few years, their unbeaten run of 59 league games and three full seasons barely registers on the fortressometer. According to the wonderful RSSSF site there are at least 19 clubs who have had longer unbeaten runs at home \u2013 including Liverpool themselves, from February 1978 to January 1981. That only took in two full seasons, but the run lasted 63 matches in total.\n\nThe best of the Premier League era is Chelsea, who went 86 matches and four full seasons without defeat at Stamford Bridge from March 2004 to October 2008, when they were beaten 1-0 by, yep, Liverpool. But when it comes to fortresses, nothing compares to the Bernab\u00e9u in the late 1950s and early 1960s.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Bernab\u00e9u in the 1950s and 60s was a football fortress like no other. Photograph: Emilio Naranjo/EPA\n\nReal Madrid were unbeaten in 121 league games \u2013 and seven full seasons \u2013 at home between February 1957, when they lost 2-0 at home to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, and March 1965. The run ended in painful circumstances for Madrid when when Jorge Mendon\u00e7a (no relation) scored the only goal to give Atl\u00e9ti a famous victory.\n\nMost draws in a promotion season\n\n\u201cWest Brom drew 17 Championship games last season \u2013 is that a record for a promoted side?\u201d asks Karin Sundmark.\n\nThat\u2019s an excellent spot, Karin, but it\u2019s not quite a record. Our first thought was Italy in the days when backpasses were still allowed, and Serie B didn\u2019t disappoint. In 1991-92, the last season before the introduction of the backpass law, both Brescia and Ancona were promoted after drawing 21 of their 34 league games. Ancona\u2019s away record was particularly special: 19 games, one win, 15 draws (F-I-F-T-E-E-N), nine of them goalless. And to think some people thought the backpass law was a bad idea.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest West Brom players celebrate after their drawtastic promotion season. Photograph: Nick Potts/PA\n\nPisa did even better in 1981-82, drawing 23 of their 38 games on their way to promotion to Serie A. And spare a thought for Perugia. We all know about the 1978-79 season, when they were unbeaten in Serie A and still didn\u2019t win the league. Six years later they lost only one of their 38 Serie B games in and still finished two points off promotion. If only they had been able to turn a couple of their TWENTY-BLOODY-SIX draws into victories.\n\nKnowledge archive\n\n\u201cKen Dodd and other comedians of his era were fond of belittling their modern counterparts by saying that if they want to be compared with the old guys, they should try playing the Glasgow Empire on a wet winter Monday after Rangers and Celtic both lost at home on the Saturday,\u201d explained in November 2003 Tom Paternoster. \u201cGiven that these two only seem to lose two games a season, has this scenario ever actually happened?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s highly unlikely, Tom. Because not only do Rangers and Celtic rarely lose on the same day, they also aren\u2019t allowed to play at home on the same day \u2013 though on 19 April 1972, Ibrox was full for a Cup Winners\u2019 Cup game against Bayern Munich just as Parkhead was for a European Cup game against Inter, which is to say that roughly 18 percent of Glasgow\u2019s population went to the game that night.\n\nBut, home or away, the Old Firm are not invincible and sometimes, they have to lose. And we\u2019re still betting that if Ken Dodd had played the Empire on Thursday 23rd August 2001, the day after Rangers and Celtic were beaten in the European Cup by Fenerbahce and Ajax respectively, the gig would have gone down about as well as Peter Ridsdale wandering into a Leeds tavern on a Saturday night.\n\nCan you help?\n\n\u201cLeon Balogun finished his 2019-20 season with Wigan at around 9.30pm on 22 July and started his 2020-21 season with Rangers at 12.30pm on Saturday 1 August.

The duchess has always insisted she did not authorise her friends to speak to the magazine.\n\nAt a preliminary hearing in London last week, Meghan\u2019s lawyers applied for the five friends to remain anonymous in reports of the proceedings, amid fears they would be named in the media.\n\nIn a ruling on Wednesday, Mr Justice Warby said he had concluded that, \u201cfor the time being at least\u201d, the duchess should be granted an order that protects the identities of the five individuals.\n\nHowever, there is still no date for a trial in the case, which has already had almost a year of legal proceedings and many court hearings.\n\nMarkle\u2019s team believes the Mail is dragging out the legal process with multiple rounds of questions in order to extract more potentially embarrassing material. Recent court disclosures as part of the case have resulted in details of her financial relationship with her father being made public as well as other details of her treatment by the British tabloids.\n\nAt an earlier hearing, lawyers for the duchess claimed the friends who spoke anonymously to a US magazine to defend her against British tabloid bullying were entitled to a \u201csuper-charged right of confidentiality\u201d.\n\nForcing her to make their names public was an \u201cunacceptable price to pay\u201d for pursuing her legal action over publication of extracts from a private letter she wrote to her estranged father, the lawyers said.\n\nIn a witness statement, she said the Mail\u2019s owner \u201cis threatening to publish the names of five women \u2013 five private citizens \u2013 who made a choice on their own to speak anonymously with a US media outlet more than a year ago, to defend me from the bullying behaviour of Britain\u2019s tabloid media.\n\n\u201cThese five women are not on trial, and nor am I.

Blackburn with Darwen council in Lancashire announced it had set up its own team on Tuesday after the national system failed to reach hundreds of its most vulnerable residents.\n\nIn other areas, including Leicester and Liverpool, council workers have been carrying out door-to-door tracing \u2013 but local health officials says incomplete data from the national system is hampering their efforts.\n\nOn Tuesday, researchers from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who modelled scenarios for the reopening of schools, warned that the test and trace system currently reaches around half of contacts and needs to improve dramatically in order to avoid a second wave, which could be bigger than the first.\n\nStarmer calls for renewed focus on testing in today\u2019s article. \u201cAlongside rapid improvements to the test-and-trace system, we need a focus on ensuring testing reaches more of the estimated 70-80% of people who don\u2019t have [coronavirus] symptoms,\u201d he writes.\n\nLabour sources highlighted current spare capacity in the testing system, saying the party would support any reasonable new moves to use that capacity to build a better national picture of the number of asymptomatic cases.\n\nA number of countries have adopted routine asymptomatic testing, including\n\nGermany, Portugal and most successfully, South Korea, which opened public testing to everyone, regardless of symptoms, from February.\n\nStarmer is to step up specific criticism of the government\u2019s systems this month, both on communication and test and trace, warning the government has less than five weeks, rather than months, to get preparations in place to tackle a resurgence of the virus once children across the UK are all back in school.\n\nA functioning test-and-trace system is the key not only to preventing a second wave, but also to unlocking the economy and building public confidence to get children back to school, Labour will warn.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great if the government are committed to getting the schools open, but polling on this hasn\u2019t shifted: parents are still concerned about sending their kids to school, that won\u2019t change without public confidence in the test-and-trace system,\u201d one Labour source said.\n\nIn his Guardian piece, Starmer says schools must be the absolute priority in September, even if that comes at economic and social cost. \u201cYoung people cannot afford another damaging U-turn like the one made by the education secretary in June,\u201d he writes. \u201cThe government must set out a clear plan this time, not just hope for the best. If that means making hard decisions elsewhere, so be it: to govern is to choose.\u201d\n\nThe Labour leader attacked the government\u2019s communications strategy, saying haphazard announcements of new local lockdowns and quarantines, as well as mixed messages on workers returning to offices, had left the public confused and anxious.\n\n\u201cGetting a grip on communications is essential. Reintroducing regular press conferences would help,\u201d he says. \u201cWorking closely with authorities, not governing by diktat, is crucial. There should be an end to anonymous, contradictory briefings to the media.\u201d Starmer\u2019s last comment is a veiled reference to ideas floated and then dismissed such as shielding advice for over-50s and reform of the quarantine system.\n\nLabour\u2019s strategy over the coming month will be to present Starmer as a leader who can work constructively but also set the government specific targets. He warns a new plan must be drawn up to protect care homes during any resurgence of the virus and calls for a redrawing of the furlough scheme to target specific industries.\n\n\u201cThe current one-size-fits-all removal of furlough risks a squeeze on jobs that could hand a P45 to people across the country,\u201d he says, while also criticising the government for spending \u201cuntargeted billions on bonuses for companies who have already brought workers back from furlough, and a stamp duty cut for landlords\u201d.\n\nStarmer, who will visit the lost Labour heartland of Stoke-on-Trent on Wednesday to hammer home his message on the need to protect jobs, said he would support any moves the government took in the coming months to improve the failures he had highlighted.\n\n\u201cThis crisis is bigger than politics. But the reality is that if the government doesn\u2019t use this summer wisely, focusing on driving down the rate of infection, Britain faces a long and bleak winter.\u201d\n\nA government spokesperson said it backed local action to tackle outbreaks, such as the steps taken in Blackburn, but stopped short of promising any imminent further expansion of testing to find asymptomatic cases.\n\nThe Department of Health and Social Care said the most recent scientific advice did not support routine testing to find a symptomatic cases and found regular testing of those without symptoms was only worthwhile among groups most likely to have been exposed to the virus, such as in care settings.\n\n\u201cNHS test and trace is already working \u2013 last week over 80% of those testing positive were reached, with over 75% of their contacts reached as well,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cWe have rapidly built, from scratch, the largest diagnostic testing industry in British history. Over 2.6 million people have been tested in just eight weeks and we have the capacity to carry out more than 330,000 tests per day, growing to 500,000 per day by the end of October.\u201d"}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/aug/05/britons-tv-covid-lockdown-ofcom-streaming-netflix-amazon", "published": "2020-08-04T23:01:14", "title": "Britons watched TV for 40% of waking hours during Covid lockdown", "text": "Britons spent 40% of their waking hours watching TV during the height of the coronavirus pandemic, with 12 million new sign-ups to services such as Netflix, as the public sought to relieve the boredom of the nationwide lockdown.\n\nThe typical person spent six hours and 25 minutes each day keeping informed and entertained at the height of the lockdown in April \u2013 almost a third more, about 90 minutes each day \u2013 than during the same month last year.\n\nThe biggest driver of this increase in viewing was a doubling in the amount of time people spent watching subscription streaming services \u2013 such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Disney+ \u2013 to more than a hour per day, according to broadcasting regulator Ofcom\u2019s annual study of the nation\u2019s media habits.

About 7 million of those already use at least one service such as Netflix and decided to bulk up their entertainment options; about 2 million had previously been signed up to a service but had stopped their subscription; and 3 million were new to streaming.\n\nBefore lockdown, about 15m UK homes were signed up to at least one of Netflix, Amazon Prime Video or Sky\u2019s Now TV service.\n\nThe lockdown provided the perfect launch conditions for Disney+, which debuted in the UK on 24 March, a day after Boris Johnson ordered the nation to stay at home.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Star Wars: The Mandalorian helped attract viewers to Disney+. Photograph: AP\n\nOfcom estimates that by June the service, stacked with family favourites including Frozen, Toy Story 4 and The Incredibles 2, had overtaken the BBC iPlayer in popularity among children aged three to 11 years old. While use of the BBC\u2019s iPlayer by children declined from 26% to 22% of homes, Disney+ established itself in a third of homes as parents looked to keep children entertained while schools were closed. The Disney+ service passed Sky\u2019s Now TV during lockdown to become the third most popular subscription streaming service in the UK, after Netflix and Amazon Prime Video.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true that it has been almost perfect conditions for all the major streaming services,\u201d said Richard Broughton, an analyst at Ampere. \u201cUnder lockdown there has been a lack of alternative entertainment options where you couldn\u2019t see friends and cinemas, restaurants, pubs and clubs were closed. And with traditional TV there has been a relatively limited variety of shows, people were rapidly running out of things to watch.\u201d\n\nOfcom\u2019s research shows that the UK\u2019s public service TV broadcasters \u2013 the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Channel 5 and Scotland\u2019s STV \u2013 benefited from huge audience figures early during the lockdown but that boost proved to be short-lived.\n\nThe thirst for information as the pandemic spread proved a boon in particular for the BBC, which was the most popular source of news in the first week of lockdown, used by 82% of UK adults.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest BBC drama Normal People was released on the iPlayer in late April.

However, the popularity of broadcast TV peaked early in the pandemic, with daily viewing reaching three hours 46 minutes, the highest level since 2013, during the last week of March when Johnson announced the nationwide lockdown.\n\nWith TV and film production halted due to the pandemic, broadcasters had to begin rationing dwindling stocks of staple hit shows such as Coronation Street and Eastenders while others were delayed or cancelled, such as Love Island and the European football championships, hurting viewing figures.\n\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n\nOfcom found that by the end of June while video streaming services held on to their uplift in viewing, including the BBC iPlayer, Channel 4\u2019s All4 and ITV\u2019s Hub, broadcast TV viewing had fallen by 44 minutes a day from its early pandemic peak.\n\nThe surge in popularity of streaming services during the pandemic looks set to become the new normal for many converts. Ofcom found that more than half of adults (55%) said they would continue to watch the same amount of extra content on streaming services they did during lockdown.\n\n\u201cThe pandemic showed public service broadcasting at its best, delivering trusted news and UK content that viewers really value,\u201d said Yih-Choung Teh, the strategy and research group director at Ofcom. \u201cBut UK broadcasters face a tough advertising market, production challenges and financial uncertainty.

Black and minority ethnic workers, who make up 12% of the UK workforce, account for 18% of jobs in this industry, according to analysis of the Labour Force Survey.\n\nUK coronavirus job losses: the latest data on redundancies and furloughs Read more\n\nThe companies that have announced job cuts include Royal Mail, which said 2,000 of its workers would be made redundant, and British Airways, which said 12,000 jobs would go.\n\nThe accommodation and food services sector, where BAME people are also overrepresented, making up 15% of the staff, had the third-highest number of redundancies, with 16,000 announced as of 28 July.\n\nThis sector, which includes hotels and restaurants, also had the highest proportion of furloughed workers, with almost three-quarters of eligible jobs furloughed up to 30 June.\n\nWholesale and retail, which has a roughly proportionate number of BAME workers, had the second-highest number of redundancies, with almost 24,000 job losses.\n\nThe analysis chimes with research published by the House of Commons Library, which found there were above average numbers of BAME workers in areas of the economy that had shut down.\n\nMore than 150,000 redundancies have been announced in the UK since the start of the pandemic, according to the Guardian\u2019s tracker, with more expected as the government\u2019s furlough scheme comes to an end in October.\n\nKimberly McIntosh, a senior policy officer at Runnymede Trust, said: \u201cWith the furlough scheme winding down, a tsunami of redundancies has been predicted. This research tells us it has already begun, with ethnic minorities on the frontline of the pandemic\u2019s economic fallout.\n\n\u201cBlack and ethnic minority communities have borne the brunt of the pandemic, facing a disproportionate fatality rate and are now being hit harder by job losses too. The pandemic is bringing the harsh realities of longstanding racial inequalities in health, the labour market, housing and education, into sharp focus.\u201d\n\nSome BAME groups are less likely to have wealth to help weather a financial downturn, according to a recent Runnymede Trust report.\n\nIt found black African and Bangladeshi households had about 10 times less savings or assets than white British households, which held the most wealth, closely followed by Indian families.\n\nBlack African and Bangladeshi groups reported wealth of \u00a330,000 or less, compared with \u00a3282,000 on average for white families.\n\nHeadline unemployment rates have decreased substantially since 2001, but the overall rate masks significant variations for different ethnic groups. For example, the unemployment rate among black people has always been at least twice as high as the rate among white people for the past two decades.\n\nBangladeshi and black people had the highest unemployment rates as of the first quarter of this year, with 9.3% and 9% unemployed respectively, compared with 3.6% of white people, according to the ONS Labour Force Survey.\n\nBlack and Bangladeshi households were also the most likely to be receiving benefits, with about one in three families in each group receiving income-related benefits, compared with 17% of white households. Bangladeshi workers had the lowest hourly wages of any group, according to 2018 data, earning \u00a39.60 an hour on average, compared with \u00a312.03 for white workers.\n\nWhile it has been mandatory for companies to report their gender pay gaps since 2017, there is no requirement for companies to monitor their racial pay disparities, despite a Conservative party manifesto pledge on the issue.\n\nMarsha de Cordova, the shadow secretary of state for women and equalities, has called on the government to introduce a targeted extension of the furlough scheme for the hardest-hit sectors and publish an equality impact assessment of the financial and social measures it has taken so far to protect and support people through the pandemic. The latter demand was echoed by McIntosh who said it was crucial the government supported black and minority ethnic communities in weathering the economic storm.\n\nDe Cordova said: \u201cNot only have black, Asian and minority ethnic communities been hit disproportionately by coronavirus in terms of their health, but now there is mounting evidence that they will be disproportionately hit by the economic crisis too.\n\n\u201cThe government has so far not paid sufficient care or attention to how different groups have been financially affected by the economic crisis.

It is able to do really straightforward cases but the minute they get more complicated it struggles,\u201d he said.\n\nBurnham said that in more deprived areas people were not returning calls from contact tracers because they cannot afford to self-isolate, and did not want to hand over contacts for them also to be told to miss work.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe only way you can deal with these problems is a more local approach \u2013 door knocking and support for all employees to self-isolate. If anyone gets a request to isolate from test and trace, they should be able to do it immediately on full pay on the same principle as jury service.\u201d\n\nUnder the national system, call handlers aim to make contact with all infected people and those they have come into contact with, to advise them to self-isolate. If they cannot make contact after 10 calls, they are advised to move on to the next case.\n\nThe government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies said the programme needs to reach at least 80% of people within 48 hours to be effective. The government says it is contacting 81% of Covid-positive people each week and reaching 75% of their contacts.\n\nHowever, researchers said on Tuesday that only 50% of contacts were being traced, according to an analysis of government figures. The researchers, from UCL and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the national system must improve significantly if schools were to safely reopen next month.\n\nTim Swift, leader of Calderdale council, said there was \u201ctwo or three gaps\u201d in the national system that it would plug with its own model, which it hopes to begin next Wednesday.\n\nHe said the national call centre-based approach was fine for some areas, but was failing to understand \u201csomething as basic as getting names right\u201d in communities where full names do not always \u201cfit neatly into a first-name-surname function\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe understand that and find it easier to handle,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to just know someone is a private hire driver, but also where they work. And also you want to be able to follow up when people do not give full information and sometimes the only way to do that is to knock on a door.\u201d\n\nBen Leaman, consultant in public health at Calderdale, said the council would use native speakers of Urdu, Czech and Slovak to knock on the doors of people the national system had been unable to reach. All positive cases would get a text message from the council with a local number to call \u2013 a recognition of the fact many people were unwilling to call an 0300 number, often believing it to be a hoax. If they don\u2019t reply within 24 hours they get a knock on the door.\n\nIt is understood that the government is looking to ramp up its support for the worst-hit areas in England, including by assigning ring-fenced groups of contact tracers and providing them with scripts supplemented with local information.\n\nIn Greater Manchester, which accounts for five of the 10 worst-hit areas in England, a large team of specialist contact tracers has been established to track down complex cases such as rough sleepers and asylum seekers. The region\u2019s director of public health, Kate Ardern, said it had managed to reach 98-100% of the cases referred to the regional team.\n\nA spokesman for the Greater Manchester Combined Authority said it was in discussions with Public Health England about establishing a similar operation to Blackburn, enabling it to contact people the national system had not been able to reach \u201cof whom there are still too many\u201d.\n\nIn Leicester, the first city in Britain to be placed in a local lockdown on 29 June, the council\u2019s own test-and-trace system has contacted 122 of the 136 people referred to it by the national system, a success rate of 89%, a council spokesman said. \u201cOur success rate locally shows that such work can be done far more effectively at a local level, by people who know the communities in which they are working, than by relying on it being done nationally,\u201d he added.\n\nCumbria launched a local test and trace system at the end of May, when its director of public health, Colin Cox, was \u201cdeeply worried\u201d that England\u2019s lockdown restrictions were about to be relaxed without a national system in place.\n\nCox said its programme was \u201cmaking connections between cases that the national system is not making\u201d and he would be happy to take on all contact tracing for the region \u201cif we had the resources\u201d.\n\nAn example of the locally-driven approach, he said, was how they dealt with an outbreak in a pub. The national system would have simply told the infected person\u2019s contacts to self-isolate, whereas local officials would contact the pub and try to reach all of its customers and issue a targeted local appeal.\n\nA government spokesman said: \u201cOur priority is to curb the spread of this virus and save lives, and local action to tackle outbreaks and keep people safe is a crucial part of the national NHS test and trace service.\n\n\u201cWe continue to work closely with all local authorities and are providing targeted, additional support where needed, including in Blackburn with Darwen where we have assigned a ring-fenced group of NHS contact tracers to follow up positive cases.\u201d"}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/aug/05/one-in-eight-childcare-workers-in-england-earn-less-than-5-an-hour", "published": "2020-08-04T23:01:15", "title": "One in eight childcare workers in England earn less than \u00a35 an hour", "text": "Report finds workload and lack of career development having an adverse effect on the sector\n\nOne in eight childcare workers in England earn less than \u00a35 an hour\n\nOne in eight childcare workers in England earn less than \u00a35 an hour, according to new research which warns that low pay, high workload and a lack of career development are having an adverse effect on the sector.\n\nThe Social Mobility Commission (SMC) report says there are signs the early years workforce is becoming increasingly unstable, warning that high staff turnover risks undermining the quality of provision and disadvantaged children\u2019s outcomes.\n\nSocial mobility in decline in Britain, official survey finds Read more\n\nThere are also fears the ongoing disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, which is threatening the survival of many nurseries and early years settings, will further exacerbate the problems facing the sector.\n\nAmong the most striking findings in the research, which was carried out by the Education Policy Institute (EPI) on behalf of the SMC, is that as many as 13% of childcare workers are paid under \u00a35 an hour.\n\nThe average wage in the sector is \u00a37.42 \u2013 less than the minimum wage and significantly below the average pay for female workers at \u00a311.37 and \u00a312.57 for the total population \u2013 and jobs are seen as low status, according to the analysis.\n\nDr Sara Bonetti, report author and director of early years at the EPI, said the workforce included apprentices, students on placement, volunteers as well as childminders, hence the low hourly rates.

One in 10 women and other people with a uterus of reproductive age have the disease.\n\nThe women taking in part in the study had not given their consent to be judged for their attractiveness and did not know this was happening as part of their medical consultations. The study received ethics approval and was publicly funded by the University of Milan school of medicine. The authors asked the women about their sexual history and measured their body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio and breast-to-underbreast ratio. Only Caucasian women were selected for inclusion in the study.\n\nAuthors have defended the study, saying that knowing if certain phenotypes \u2013 or bodily characteristics \u2013 were more susceptible to severe endometriosis would be useful. The lead researcher, Dr Paolo Vercellini, an obstetrician and gynaecologist at Universita degli Studi in Milan and past president of the World Endometriosis Society, said: \u201cSeveral researchers believe that a general phenotype exists which is associated with the disease.\u201d\n\nBut critics, including American gynaecologist Dr Jennifer Gunter, have pointed out that while characteristics such as body mass index may be relevant to endometriosis severity, this is not what the study actually measured. She wrote at the time: \u201cI fail to understand how a small group of Italian doctors rating attractiveness of women with different stages of endometriosis contributes anything to medical science.\n\n\u201cFertility Sterility should be ashamed they accepted it for publication,\u201d she wrote, adding: \u201cObjectifying women has no place in medicine.

She told the Guardian she was \u201cshocked\u201d it had been retracted after the journal had defended it for so long but worried that by retracting it, the lessons from it would be lost.\n\n\u201cThis non-apology, this retraction, seven years after many people had written to \u2026 [the authors and editors], with no comments from the editor, I think is cowardly.\u201d\n\nSzabo said she was disappointed the editorial board of Fertility and Sterility had not issued an apology or provided a justification of why they did not retract it earlier. She said there were systemic and cultural issues within healthcare and medicine that has led to studies like this one being conceived and published.\n\n\u201cThe question is: how is it possible that [this study was] conceived? It was 2012, not 1912.\n\n\u201cThis is a really significant journal and it\u2019s a journal that primarily goes towards women\u2019s health.\u201d\n\nShe added that the time taken to retract the study is the average time it takes to be diagnosed with endometriosis.\n\nDr Kate Young, a public health researcher at Queensland University of Technology whose previous work has focused endometriosis, has been instrumental in bringing this study to the public\u2019s attention. She said it was an example of studies that get published but do not actually help women and other people with the condition.\n\n\u201cThat paper is a really good example of what happens when we do research about women but not for them. And that\u2019s partly a reflection of the patriarchal society that we live in and also the way we\u2019ve structured research and research funding.\n\n\u201cWe really need better systems in place that come from the bottom up.

And what do kangaroos have to do with it?\n\nMichael, I couldn\u2019t help but notice the reporter grilling president Donald Trump in the White House this week had a peculiar accent. Is he one of yours?\n\nHi Matthew! Very perceptive of you. The Axios reporter with the furrowed brow and comically perplexed expression is Jonathan Swan, a former Sydney Morning Herald journalist. After making his name as a political reporter here in Australia, Swan moved to the US in 2014 to work as a Congressional aide as part of an academic fellowship. Since then he\u2019s worked as a reporter at the Hill before moving to Axios in 2016. Since the Trump interview he has become a hugely popular meme thanks to his quizzical response to the president\u2019s insistence the US was doing better than any other country in tackling Covid-19.\n\nSo he\u2019s sort of adopted the US as his home country. Has he ever been involved in any particularly Australian stories?\n\nHere in Australia, Swan is best remembered for his scoops about politicians abusing their parliamentary entitlements. Oh, and a story about a senator throwing kangaroo faeces at his brother.\n\nSorry, what?\n\nThe kangaroo poo story. You don\u2019t know about it?\n\nNo \u2026\n\n'They're dying \u2026 it is what it is': key takeaways from Trump's shocking interview Read more\n\nWeird! Well, in 2013, thanks to a bizarre trick of electoral maths, a bunch of candidates from so-called \u201cmicro parties\u201d found themselves elected to the Australian Senate despite receiving a minuscule number of votes. One of those lucky few was Ricky Muir, a candidate for the Motoring Enthusiasts party. While the rest of the country was still figuring out how the hell it had happened, Swan went digging into Muir\u2019s past and unearthed a video of the soon-to-be senator running around a campsite hurling kangaroo faeces at his brother while laughing hysterically.\n\nNot all his stories were so, um, faecal, though. In 2014 Swan was awarded the prestigious Wallace Brown young achiever award for journalism after a string of scoops about the questionable use of taxpayer funds by politicians, which led to an overhaul of the rules governing parliamentary entitlements and expenses.\n\nSo, sounds as though he was well prepared for interviewing our president.\n\nIt certainly seems like it. Things didn\u2019t go so well the last time he interviewed Trump, though. Swan faced a ferocious backlash in 2018 and was labelled a \u201cbootlicker\u201d and called \u201cgrotesque\u201d for the way he handled the president\u2019s admission that he wanted to end automatic citizenship for immigrant children born in the US. In the interview, Swan smiled widely as Trump confirmed the news, and, as the New York Times put it, his tone-deaf delivery on Twitter (\u201cexcited to share\u201d) left him open to criticism that he \u201cfavours access over accountability\u201d. Despite landing a string of exclusives, including being the first to reveal the US withdrawal from the Paris climate accord, Swan was pigeonholed as the kind of inside-the-beltway reporter who cares more about the scoop than the audience.\n\nThis time, though, he treated Trump respectfully without bowing down \u2013 as you\u2019d treat a friend who decides they\u2019re a libertarian after reading Ayn Rand. His running commentary (\u201cwhat manuals?\u201d, \u201cwho are you talking about?\u201d) felt like an echo of my own internal monologue whenever I listen to that guy.\n\nSwan\u2019s big \u201cinsider guy\u201d energy seemed to help this time around. To me, the whole interview felt a little bit like being a fly on the wall in the kind of \u201con background\u201d conversations journalists have all the time with sources. Swan is not a TV host, so his delivery was sort of ambling and chatty, which seemed to help. He pushed back, but he also got on Trump\u2019s level and gave the president all the rope he needed.\n\nBut, OK, let\u2019s get to the serious stuff. Is Jonathan Swan his real name? He sounds like an 18th-century poet or a 90s heartthrob.\n\nIt\u2019s real! In fact, he\u2019s from a famous line of Australian journalist Swans. His father, Norman Swan, is a physician and health reporter for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and is a celebrity in his own right. Norman has become ubiquitous during the pandemic, hosting a wildly popular podcast and showing up on our televisions to explain important subjects such as why we should wear face masks and whether our farts can spread Covid-19.\n\nOK.

But his dream of earning a university degree remained elusive.\n\nEventually, in 2017, Patern\u00f2 enrolled in the department of philosophy at the University of Palermo.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d wake up at seven to study,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d use an old typewriter to complete my assignments. I\u2019d rest in the afternoon and in the evening I\u2019d study until midnight. My neighbours used to ask, \u2018why all this trouble at your age?\u2019 But they couldn\u2019t understand the importance of reaching a dream, regardless of my age.\u201d\n\nWith a few exams left, the Covid-19 pandemic risked stalling his graduation. When courses transitioned to remote learning platforms, Patern\u00f2 was obliged to come to terms with the new technology.\n\n\u201cWhen the pandemic arrived, we started to fear for his health,\u201d said Ninni Patern\u00f2, Giuseppe\u2019s son. \u201cI told my father that we could postpone exams and that he could go back to classes in the autumn. But he said no. He said that, given his advanced age, he feared he wouldn\u2019t make it through the summer.\u201d\n\nPatern\u00f2\u2019s dream came to fruition last Friday, when he graduated first in his class with top honours. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the happiest days of my entire life,\u201d he said. \u201cI only wish my wife were here to see me. She died 14 years ago.\u201d\n\nHas Patern\u00f2 stopped dreaming? On the contrary. \u201cI\u2019m considering carrying on for a master\u2019s degree. My mother lived to be 100. If the numbers and the genetics are on my side, then I still have four years left.\u201d"}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/aug/05/throng-of-new-penguin-colonies-in-antarctica-spotted-from-space", "published": "2020-08-04T23:01:15", "title": "Throng of new penguin colonies in Antarctica spotted from space", "text": "Satellite images have revealed 11 previously unknown emperor penguin colonies in Antarctica, boosting the number of known colonies of the imperilled birds by 20%.\n\nThe discoveries were made by spotting the distinctive red-brown guano patches the birds leave on the ice. The finds were made possible by higher-resolution images from a new satellite, as previous scans were unable to pick up smaller colonies.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Emperor penguins are the only penguins that breed on sea ice, making them especially vulnerable to the climate crisis. Photograph: British Antarctic Survey\n\nTwo of the colonies were a particular surprise. They were found far from the coast, living on sea ice that is anchored to grounded icebergs, a location never seen before.\n\nThe new colonies are thought to number a few hundred penguins each, which is smaller than average, so the discoveries increase the total population of emperor penguins by a smaller proportion of about 5-10%.\n\nEmperor penguins are the only penguins that breed on sea ice, rather than land, making them especially vulnerable to the climate crisis. All the new colonies are in areas that are at risk and researchers say these will be the \u201ccanaries in the coal mine\u201d as global heating increasingly affects Antarctica.\n\n\u201cThe [new colonies] are an exciting discovery,\u201d said Peter Fretwell, at the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), who led the research. \u201cWhilst this is good news, the colonies are small and so only take the overall population count up to just over half a million penguins.\u201d\n\nPhilip Trathan, also at BAS, said: \u201cThe new breeding sites are all in locations where recent model projections suggest emperor penguins will decline. These birds are therefore probably the canaries in the coalmine \u2013 we need to watch these sites carefully as climate change will affect this region.\u201d\n\nFretwell said one of the colonies was 112 miles (180km) from the Antarctic continent: \u201cMany of the penguin scientists we have talked to were disbelieving, as normally you expect them to be at the coast.\u201d Emperor penguins need stable sea ice, usually attached to land, for nine months of the year to breed successfully.\n\nThere were only 30 colonies known a decade ago, as they are usually in remote and inaccessible locations, where temperatures can fall as low as -50C in winter. But then Landsat satellite images began to be used. These have a resolution of 30 metres, which is enough to spot the larger colonies.\n\nThe European Space Agency\u2019s Sentinel-2 satellite was launched in June 2015 and has a resolution of 10 metres. This enabled a search for the smaller penguin colonies, as reported by the BAS scientists in the journal Remote Sensing in Ecology and Conservation.\n\nEmperor penguins were expected to be present at fairly regular intervals around the coast of Antarctica, so the search was targeted in areas where none were known. \u201cIn every gap where we thought there might be a colony, we found one,\u201d said Fretwell.\n\nThree of the 11 colonies found had been suspected following ship or aeroplane sightings of penguins in the 1960s and 1980s, but Sentinel-2 images confirmed their presence. There are now 61 known emperor colonies around Antarctica. \u201cThere may be one or two very small colonies yet to be discovered, but I think we have filled in all the gaps now,\u201d said Fretwell.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Close-up satellite image showing penguins in the snow around a foraging crack. Photograph: British Antarctic Survey\n\nThe next step is to direct satellites with very high, 30cm-resolution cameras over the colonies to enable the penguins to be counted. \u201cIt is dark at the moment in Antarctica, so we can\u2019t count them yet,\u201d said Fretwell. \u201cThe sun will come up either later this month or next month in most of these locations, and then we will start.\u201d\n\nPrevious studies have estimated that 90% of known colonies will be lost by the end of the century if no further action is taken to cut the greenhouse gas emissions that drive global heating. Even in the best case scenario, where deep and fast cuts to carbon emissions limit the rise in global temperature to 1.5C, the population of emperor penguins is projected to fall by 30%.\n\n\u2022 This article was amended on 5 August 2020.

The plaintiffs allege they were made to work for up to 14 hours a day without pay and were physically abused.\n\nNestl\u00e9 and Cargill deny aiding and abetting forced labour and say they are not liable under the Alien Tort Statute.\n\nBoth companies said they condemned the use of child labour. Nestle added that all parties involved in the case agreed the company did not engage in child labour. Cargill said the plaintiffs do not allege they worked on farms from which the company purchased cocoa.\n\nThe case has ping-ponged between district and circuit judges for the past 15 years. The latest ruling in 2018 backed the plaintiffs. A circuit court in California judged the allegations \u201cplausible\u201d and ruled that the companies could be held liable under the tort.\n\n\n\nUS human rights organisations expressed alarm but not surprise at the supreme court\u2019s decision last month to review the companies\u2019 case.\n\nThe Alien Tort Statute has come under sustained attack from business groups since its adoption in the late 1990s by human rights activists. In 2017, the supreme court had already ruled that non-US corporations could not be sued under the legislation.\n\nAccording to Charity Ryerson, executive director at the campaign group Corporate Accountability Lab, the appeal represents a \u201cnail-in-the-coffin moment\u201d for corporate accountability. \u201cIf this case survives, it will change everything. If this is shut down, it will be the final straw.\u201d\n\nThe latter scenario would incentivise companies to become \u201clazier\u201d about monitoring their supply chains and \u201cpotentially more abusive\u201d in their operations, she added. The exception would be human trafficking, for which corporations can still be held liable under the US Trafficking Victims Protection Act.\n\n\u201cIf in the United States we cannot file cases against US companies that have violated human rights overseas, when we have jurisdiction over them here [in US], then we are creating a safe haven for human rights abusers,\u201d Ryerson argued.\n\nIn a statement, Cargill said the company does not tolerate human trafficking, forced or child labour in its operations or supply chain. \u201cWe take steps to understand potential problems, while continuing to work actively to protect human rights, with a firm commitment to protecting the rights of the child worldwide.\u201d\n\nIt added: \u201cWe are committed to achieving zero incidents of child labour in our cocoa supply chain by 2025. If violations are identified, we take immediate steps to suspend the supplier.\u201d\n\nA Nestl\u00e9 spokesperson maintained that child labour in foreign countries is a \u201ccomplex, global social problem\u201d. It said the company now has \u201cexplicit policies against it\u201d, including a monitoring and remediation system designed to engage with households where children are at risk and provide remediation measures.\n\n\u201cThis lawsuit does not advance the shared goal of ending child labour in the cocoa industry because it does not address the root causes of the issue and will not improve the conditions in west Africa,\u201d a spokesperson for the company continued.\n\n\u201cAll involved agree that Nestl\u00e9 never engaged in the egregious child labour alleged in this suit,\u201d the spokesperson added, noting that all the cocoa used in its US products is now certified under the UTZ sustainability standard.\n\nThe supreme court is scheduled to commence appeal hearings in the autumn."}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/aug/04/beirut-explosion-scores-dead-and-thousands-hurt-as-blast-rips-through-city-video-report", "published": "2020-08-04T22:37:50", "title": "Beirut explosion: scores dead and thousands hurt as blast rips through city \u2013 video report", "text": "Beirut has been rocked by a huge explosion, devastating parts of the city and injuring thousands of people.

Global streaming has since allowed for the overwhelming popularity of slick K-pop titans BTS, the doleful flamenco flourishes of Spanish artist Rosal\u00eda and the multilingual Nigerian superstar Burna Boy among others, suggesting that, at last, non-English-language hits are moving beyond novelties such as The Ketchup Song and Dragostea Din Tei.\n\nBut three summers on from Despacito, the UK remains dominated by English-language pop. Latin music hasn\u2019t had nearly the same impact here as in the US, and Christine and the Queens\u2019 \u201cNe me cherche pas, je ne suis plus la, baby\u201d was a very rare burst of French on British radio, via Gone, her hit song with Charli XCX last year. (It feels telling that Belgian singer-songwriter Ang\u00e8le, one of France and Belgium\u2019s biggest new artists, has made no real attempt to break the UK market.) Music made by dominant immigrant communities in the UK, such as those of Punjabi origin such as bhangra \u2013 even crossovers such as Birmingham rapper Mist and producer Steel Banglez joining forces for multilingual shout-outs (\u201cHold tight all my apnas, karlas, goras\u201d) \u2013 is not consumed by the masses.\n\nBurna Boy. Photograph: RMV/REX/Shutterstock\n\nOne successful non-English \u2013 or at least culturally distinct \u2013 form of pop is Afrobeats, adored by the west African diaspora and beyond, and a frequent presence in the Top 40 via artists based in Africa or in the UK with African heritage. The Official Charts Company have just announced the introduction of the Afrobeats chart to bring African pop styles together under one catch-all name, to join other specialist charts including metal and dance. But for all the smatterings of, for example, pidgin, for the most part these artists are singing in straight English.\n\nIt\u2019s not to say that non-Anglophone pop has no reception at all \u2013 the likes of Blackpink and BTS have sold out arenas thanks to their devoted fanbases. But if we are looking at the charts as a barometer for nationwide popularity, non-English-language music rarely features. Occasionally songs become relatively successful in the UK charts when a western artist collaborates with them \u2013 Halsey featured on BTS\u2019s Boy With Luv which made it to No 13; Lady Gaga\u2019s recent track with Blackpink reached No 17 \u2013 but British audiences seem to need this Anglophone element to engage with foreign pop. Yes, Despacito reached No 1 here, but it was only after Justin Bieber appeared on it.\n\nA longstanding stereotype about British people is, of course, an unwillingness to learn another language; Brits abroad are known for their loud, slow \u201cparlay-vooz onglay?\u201d In a 2014 survey, the UK tied as the third least likely country in Europe to speak a foreign language. Perhaps a language barrier, and an unwillingness to move past that, means the general UK population is just less likely to engage with tracks they don\u2019t immediately understand. This is valid, of course. All countries have a focus on local releases when it comes to promotion and radio play, and it makes sense that we identify and enjoy songs that relate to our own experiences, and that are in our native language. Perhaps that\u2019s why Puerto Rico artist Bad Bunny\u2019s album YHLQMDLG didn\u2019t even reach the Top 100 in the UK, but in the US, where Spanish is the second most spoken language, it debuted at No 2 to become the highest-charting all-Spanish album ever.\n\nThen again, as David Byrne writes in his excellent essay I Hate World Music, art \u201ccommunicates the vibe, the feeling, the attitude toward our lives, in a way that is personal and universal at the same time\u201d. Language plays a part in our understanding of music that resonates, of course, but the emotions evoked by a good song often go beyond what is being said \u2013 like Byrne says, it\u2019s the feeling. It is also insulting to assume that no one is looking up foreign-language song meanings, in the exact same way they might comb through lyric website Genius to understand the multiple meanings of a particularly potent and poetic rap bar: many an Anglophone K-pop fan has spoken of trying to learn Korean through an artist\u2019s lyrics.\n\nIn a 2018 review of their album Love Yourself: Tear, Guardian journalist Alexis Petridis posited that maybe BTS were so popular because \u201cif boyband fandom is all about projecting your fantasies on to the performers, then perhaps a group whose lyrics you don\u2019t understand represent an appealingly blank screen\u201d. Fans were incensed. \u201cAs if it\u2019s that difficult to get a translation online nowadays, or understand a feeling that exists beyond words\u201d, Brazilian music journalist Biju Belinky responded in her column for Vice.\n\nK-pop group Blackpink. Photograph: UMusic\n\nFor Belinky, the reason for the lack of chart success for non-English language songs is due to the monopoly of English language and culture. She tells me: \u201cIt maintains the idea of English as the only valid language to communicate and create art in, if you want to be relevant, which in turn sustains the idea that English-speaking countries are the epicentre of the world and hold the key to what is good or bad art, good or bad music. People from Anglophone countries ... are used to being catered to. So they mock [non-English pop].\u201d She points to the more mean-spirited memes made about Gangnam Style and Despacito. \u201cBecause as long as you make fun of it, you don\u2019t have to accept that there\u2019s more to the world.\u201d\n\nBelinky is talking about Anglophone countries in general here, and the music industry\u2019s refusal to centre non-English language music. An example: the MTV awards created a new category for K-pop last year, in a move that many perceived as xenophobic, ghettoising these artists away from the main categories.\n\nBut why is the UK specifically so resistant to other languages, and why isn\u2019t the monopoly Belinky describes eroding? It\u2019s easy, of course, to paint this as another sign of this country\u2019s not-so-latent racism. In the hostile environment of Brexit Britain, maybe people want English songs because they\u2019ve internalised the idea that foreigners have ruined everything, and that British is best. This is perhaps a simplification. More pernicious is the way that a music industry dominated by white British men will tend to champion artists that tell stories about their lives \u2013 and why, beyond their evident talent, the likes of Lewis Capaldi, Sam Fender, Tom Walker, Dermot Kennedy and more are so successful versus, say, a black artist making similar, soulful music such as Samm Henshaw. Language is perhaps part of a bigger picture of how the industry, and audience, focuses on what it knows \u2013 lyrically, culturally, racially.\n\nRina Sawayama\n\nThis lack of diversity and inclusivity makes artists who deviate from the \u201cnorm\u201d seem exotic and inaccessible, even if the music they\u2019re making is actually anything but. Take Rina Sawayama, the Japanese-British singer who makes gloriously contemporary pop \u2013 and sings in English. But in spite of being critically acclaimed (her debut album Sawayama, released earlier this year, currently boasts an 89% score on reviews aggregate Metacritic) and adored by her fans, the Pixels, her music didn\u2019t reach the Top 100 of either the albums or singles charts. One has to speculate about whether this would be the case if she was a white woman making the same music. It\u2019s also revealing that Sawamaya is considered ineligible for the Mercury prize, in spite of having lived in the UK for 25 years with leave to remain (she is 29). There is so much systemic hostility, xenophobia and outright racism in this sector that needs to be picked apart.\n\nThe UK music industry is predominantly made up of white British people (a 2018 UK Music report showed 17.8% BAME representation), and so knowledge of how to sell artists who fall outside of that specific criteria is lower than it should be. It\u2019s not to say that change won\u2019t come, though \u2013 perhaps especially now the music industry is being forced to consider hierarchies pertaining to race in the aftermath of #TheShowMustBePaused. The charts may also become an increasingly redundant measure of success. Virality on TikTok or Instagram is arguably more meaningful to a younger generation \u2013 take Jawsh 685\u2019s track Laxed (Siren Beat), which was dominating Gen Z feeds for weeks before it reached No 1. More broadly, the passionate, atomised communities around K-pop, Arabic hip-hop or any other non-English sound are ultimately just as valid as mass-cultural ones.\n\nIndustry diversity and restructuring, as well as changes in how we think about success, could finally erode the dominance of English-language pop in the UK. But in the charts for now, Despacito looks less like it was the start of something new, and more like just another novelty."}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/aug/05/sean-hannity-removes-gobbledygook-latin-motto-from-book-cover", "published": "2020-08-05T10:51:57", "title": "Sean Hannity removes 'gobbledygook' Latin motto from book cover", "text": "Change was made after a classics student pointed out that the phrase on the original cover of Live Free or Die made no sense\n\nThe Latin motto on Fox News anchor Sean Hannity\u2019s new book has been changed after the original was described as \u201ccomplete and utter gobbledygook\u201d by a classics student.\n\nHannity\u2019s Live Free or Die: America (and the World) on the Brink, which argues \u201cnow is an All Hands on Deck moment to save the Republic\u201d, was published on Tuesday. But as Business Insider pointed out, the Latin motto it uses as a subtitle has been quietly changed from the original jacket.\n\nAt first, the cover featured the Latin tagline \u201cvivamus vel libero perit Americae\u201d \u2013 a phrase that Hannity told viewers on Fox means \u201clive free or America dies\u201d. But as Indiana University Bloomington classics student Spencer Alexander McDaniel laid out on his blog in May, the Latin phrase makes little sense.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that whoever came up with this motto does not even know the basic noun cases in Latin or how they work,\u201d wrote McDaniel. \u201cThe words in Hannity\u2019s motto are real Latin words, but, the way they are strung together, they don\u2019t make even a lick of sense.\u201d\n\nMcDaniel, who was not the only classicist to question Hannity\u2019s \u201cperplexing\u201d Latin, translated Hannity\u2019s Latin text as \u201cLet\u2019s live or he \u2026 passes away from America for the detriment of a free man\u201d. He then inferred that the incorrect Latin had been arrived at by putting \u201clive free or America dies\u201d into Google Translate.\n\nAfter the error was shared widely on social media, the text on Hannity\u2019s book jacket was updated to \u201cVivamus liberi ne America pereat\u201d \u2013 a phrase that McDaniel says on his blog \u201cneatly translates into English to mean, \u2018Let us live free so that America will not die\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cCuriously, the unintelligible Latin word salad has vanished from the front cover and been replaced,\u201d the classics student writes. \u201cThis makes me wonder: Did someone at Threshold Editions read my blog post and realize they needed to fix the bad Latin?\u201d\n\nSince it was possible the change had been made after someone at Hannity\u2019s publisher had read his article, McDaniel went on to address the television presenter directly: \u201cSean Hannity, if you\u2019re reading this, I want you to go on your show and publicly admit that you\u2019ve done nothing on air for the past 11 years but peddle lies, nonsense, and conspiracy theories.

LGBT content was removed from Bohemian Rhapsody, Star Trek: Beyond, Alien: Covenant and Cloud Atlas, scenes where Chinese people were killed were taken out of Skyfall and Mission: Impossible III and a major character was changed from Tibetan to Celtic in Doctor Strange, a decision made by the screenwriter to avoid the risk of \u201calienating one billion people\u201d.\n\nIn the report, Stanley Rosen, professor of political science and international relations at the University of Southern California, says that the government \u201cwill focus on everything that has a China component in it. Don\u2019t think that if you\u2019re doing something that\u2019s not intended for China, that\u2019s an indie film meant for a small market, that China won\u2019t notice and that it won\u2019t hurt your blockbuster film.

This is a massive propaganda coup for the Chinese Communist party.\u201d\n\nIn June, Richard Gere appeared before the US senate to warn about the dangers of letting China control content. \u201cThe combination of Chinese censorship, coupled with American film studios\u2019 desire to access China\u2019s market, can lead to self-censorship and overlooking social issues that great American films once addressed,\u201d he said."}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/aug/05/rapper-talib-kweli-banned-from-twitter-after-dispute-with-woman", "published": "2020-08-05T12:16:01", "title": "Rapper Talib Kweli banned from Twitter after dispute with woman", "text": "Kweli has been suspended for \u2018repeated violations of Twitter rules\u2019, but denies harassing Maya Moody on the platform\n\nThe US rapper Talib Kweli has been barred from Twitter after sending dozens of messages to a woman, Maya Moody, on the platform.\n\nTwitter told the website Jezebel that it had permanently suspended Kweli\u2019s account for \u201crepeated violations of the Twitter rules \u2026 Violence, harassment and other similar types of behaviour discourage people from expressing themselves.\u201d The account had been suspended in late July, with Kweli claiming he had moved over to the website Patreon.\n\nIn an email to Jezebel, Kweli denied harassing Moody: \u201cI\u2019ve never cyber harassed anyone in my life.

But the interview wasn\u2019t about music. The subject was his days as the CIA\u2019s man in the Middle East between 1947 and 1957, during which time he dined with President Nasser of Egypt, partied with the Soviet spy Kim Philby and, as a pioneer of \u201cdirty tricks\u201d, played a part in removing the leaders of Syria and Iran.

Surrounded by books and an exotic array of musical instruments, he\u2019s a natural storyteller with a love of funny voices, florid vocabulary and wry asides, all delivered at high velocity and top volume as he bobs and weaves before the camera like a debonair boxer. He tried to turn his father\u2019s CIA years into a movie, but investors wanted to emphasise the Police connection and he didn\u2019t, so it has mutated into a very entertaining nine-part podcast for Audible.\n\nI remember hanging out with Rage Against the Machine and Zack de la Rocha was looking at me pretty funny. His main problem was that I played polo\n\nMiles Copeland Jr was born in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1916. During the second world war he was a US agent stationed in London, where he was involved in the disinformation campaign preceding D-day, and married a Scottish intelligence agent called Lorraine Adie, who later became an archaeologist. When the war ended, Miles became one of the CIA\u2019s first recruits and was posted to Syria. Though born in Virginia in 1952, the youngest of four, Stewart spent his entire childhood and adolescence in Beirut and Cairo, and attributes his drumming style to his immersion in Arabic rhythms. \u201cWe felt underprivileged,\u201d he says, \u201clike we were missing out on this unattainable land of perfection where everything was shiny and modern and cool. It wasn\u2019t until we grew up that we realised, actually, the place that we lived had a lot of cultural advantages.\u201d\n\nAfter leaving the agency in 1957, Miles became a well-paid consultant and conservative journalist. Not until 1969, when he published his bestseller The Game of Nations: The Amorality of Power Politics, did Miles\u2019s offspring finally discover what he\u2019d been up to. His children had been as oblivious to his clandestine activities as he had to Kim Philby\u2019s.\n\nA bit awkward? \u2026 Stewart Copeland of the Police on the Amnesty International benefit tour in Chicago in 1986. Photograph: Paul Natkin/WireImage\n\nWere they never bothered by the fact that their father had lied to them? \u201cHe didn\u2019t lie to us,\u201d Stewart corrects me sharply. \u201cHe just didn\u2019t tell us the whole story. But we never asked.\u201d\n\nAnd you never guessed?\n\n\u201cIt may surprise you to know \u2013 and it surprises me to recall \u2013 that we didn\u2019t think about it that much.\u201d\n\nStewart thinks Miles would have disliked the title of My Dad the Spy (\u201cHe was kind of a snob in that regard \u2013 \u2018spy\u2019 was somehow d\u00e9class\u00e9\u201d) but I don\u2019t imagine he would have any other complaints. While many musicians have unresolved issues with their fathers, Stewart, whose teenage rebellion lasted \u201cabout 20 minutes\u201d, doesn\u2019t have a bad word to say about his. In the podcast\u2019s dramatised recreations, actor Kerry Shale captures the sly southern charm that served Miles well as an agent and a parent. For a man who led a double life, he was a remarkably consistent character.\n\n\u201cEverything I learned at his knee in the family home was confirmed by the historians,\u201d says Stewart. \u201cNot only was his nature described exactly as I remember him \u2013 a very jocular, cheerful, witty, charming man \u2013 but also the stories.\u201d\n\nWhen The Game of Nations came out, Stewart was a college student in the US and the CIA\u2019s reputation was mud due to a slew of ugly revelations. Nonetheless, he thought his dad\u2019s old job was \u201ccool\u201d and has never revised that opinion. When he was in the Police, he says, it was never a major issue. \u201cI think behind our backs people did write the Copeland brothers off as rightwing monsters, but I got on pretty well with everybody. Decades later I remember hanging out with Rage Against the Machine and Zack [de la Rocha] was looking at me pretty funny but the other guys were friendly. His main problem was that I played polo.\u201d\n\nReunion \u2026 Sting, Stewart Copeland and Andy Summers of the Police perform in Hyde Park, London, in 2008. Photograph: Pete Still/Redferns\n\nStill, it must have been uncomfortable sometimes. In that 1986 interview Miles said: \u201cMy complaint has been that the CIA isn\u2019t overthrowing enough anti-American governments or assassinating enough anti-American leaders, but I guess I\u2019m getting old.\u201d Given that the Police were about to headline Amnesty International\u2019s Conspiracy of Hope tour, wasn\u2019t that a bit awkward?\n\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s right, my father\u2019s gag,\u201d Stewart laughs before stopping himself. \u201cNow I can sympathise with people from those countries who would not be amused by my father\u2019s puckish sense of humour and would have every right to look askance at this messing with the destiny of their nations.\u201d\n\nThe tone of the podcast, too, oscillates between playful and earnest. The first few episodes present Miles as an Ian Fleming character in a Graham Greene world, buccaneering his way through the Levant. Only later does Stewart confront the geopolitical implications and talk to Middle Eastern historians who blame his father for what later unfolded in Iran: no coup against prime minister Mohammad Mosaddegh in 1953, no tyrannical Shah, no Islamic revolution in 1979. Stewart hotly disagrees.\n\n\u201cGuys, 70 years have gone by! The current regime of Iran was not chosen by the CIA. It\u2019s what happened when the Iranians chose their system of governance. For right or wrong, it\u2019s theirs.\u201d\n\nBut does he really think he can be impartial about his father\u2019s role in the region?\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to my father, you\u2019re right, I cannot be objective. But I am interested in that region. I\u2019d say that 80 million Iranians are more in charge of their own country than three Americans.\u201d\n\nThe Observer newspaper dated 26 May 1985, with a report on how MI6 and CIA joined forces to plot the 1953 Iran coup. Photograph: The Observer\n\nStewart describes his father, approvingly, as Machiavellian. Unlike his intellectual mentor James Burnham, Miles was less a fanatical cold warrior than a good soldier who took great pride, and no little pleasure, in serving US interests by any means necessary. A good agent, he maintained, was amoral. So, too, despite the lofty public rhetoric, was US foreign policy.\n\n\u201cMy father\u2019s view was that democracy was like two wolves and a sheep voting on what\u2019s for dinner,\u201d says Stewart, \u201cand indeed in the Arab world it\u2019s very much like that. My father wasn\u2019t in the business of exporting democracy. He was in the business of getting the oil to the west by hook or by crook.\u201d\n\nMiles thought the CIA went downhill after Dwight Eisenhower left the White House. \u201cAlthough engaged in the same skulduggery it was much less successful,\u201d says Stewart. \u201cKennedy, Nixon, they all fucked it up. Kennedy didn\u2019t understand the military jargon. He didn\u2019t understand that \u2018a fair possibility of success\u2019 means \u2018you\u2019re fucked\u2019.\u201d Things only got worse. \u201cInstead of my father going in there and pulling some strings \u2013 a little bit of bribery here, a little bit of disinformation there, and hey, we\u2019ve got a new guy in there who\u2019s much more copacetic with our oil needs \u2013 decades later they went in and killed 100,000 Iraqis. That\u2019s. Fucked. Up.\u201d\n\nOf course, not everybody will condemn a war while absolving a coup, or make distinctions between different eras of CIA meddling. My Dad the Spy features the voices of historians, including Iranians and Syrians, who cannot forgive Miles Copeland Jr\u2019s machinations and you can hear the filial loyalty in Stewart\u2019s voice when he pushes back. Miles apparently had no regrets and Stewart has none on his behalf. Can he see his father\u2019s legacy clearly? Can any loving son or daughter? I\u2019m not sure. Our family histories are complicated enough without having to factor in the byzantine intricacies of the cold war.\n\nBefore he goes, Stewart says he hopes that Philby\u2019s children will see this interview and get back in touch. Having been childhood friends in Beirut until their father\u2019s defection to the USSR in 1963, he\u2019s a little hurt that one of them ghosted him a few years ago. Then again, he adds, \u201cI appreciate that for that family it was not a matter of amusement as it is for me.\u201d\n\n\u2022 My Dad the Spy, an Audible Original Podcast, is available to download from Audible.co.uk"}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/thehybridhero/2020/mar/11/hybrid-cars-have-to-be-plugged-in-and-five-other-common-misconceptions", "published": "2020-03-11T14:40:47", "title": "Hybrid cars have to be plugged in \u2013 and five other common misconceptions", "text": "Hybrid vehicles were developed to reduce emissions. Photograph: Jostaphot/Getty\n\nAs awareness of the climate crisis grows and urban pollution levels creep ever higher, we\u2019re all starting to think more about our carbon footprints. For those who are considering buying a car, which one to go with requires careful thought and research.\n\nShould we stick with petrol or diesel, take the plunge to buy an electric vehicle or maybe opt for a hybrid? Of these options, there tends to be the most confusion around hybrids. There are a lot of myths about these vehicles, many of them based on the early, less sophisticated versions that entered the market about 20 years ago. But it\u2019s worth busting through these concerns and getting to grips with what hybrids can offer, as for many of us they can be an excellent choice for greener, more economical and fun motoring.\n\n\u201cWe were early to market with hybrids back in the late 1990s with the Insight and then the sportier CR-Z,\u201d says Phil Webb, deputy general manager automotive at Honda UK. \u201cThese were arguably ahead of their time and are now modern classics. Fast forward 20 years and, while hybrids have changed drastically, the concerns around owning and driving them have not.\u201d\n\nHere are some of the most common misconceptions.\n\nMyth one: hybrid technology is complicated and difficult to understand\n\nThere are different types of hybrid cars, and hearing terms such as \u201cmild\u201d, \u201cfull\u201d and \u201cplug-in hybrid electric vehicle\u201d (PHEV) bandied around can be confusing. But it\u2019s quite straightforward. A hybrid car is one that uses two forms of energy to maximise efficiency and reduce emissions. Usually this means combining electrical energy contained in batteries with the combustion energy of petrol or diesel fuel.\n\n\u201cHybrid cars were developed to reduce CO 2 ,\u201d explains Nick Molden, CEO of Emissions Analytics, a global emissions testing specialist. \u201cThey do it via two means. Firstly, there\u2019s regenerative braking. When a vehicle brakes there\u2019s a lot of wasted energy. Hybrids capture this energy into the battery and it can then be used to power the vehicle. Secondly, hybrids help the engine work at optimal efficiency as much of the time as possible. Electric power is suited to lower-speed stop-start driving such as you might do in a city. And petrol and diesel engines are more suited to driving at higher, constant speeds \u2013 for example, during motorway driving. Hybrid technology means that the two parts work together in harmony, each doing what it\u2019s best at.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have deliberately made our hybrids incredibly easy to drive,\u201d says Webb. \u201cOur new CR-V hybrid has three driving modes; pure electric, hybrid and engine-only \u2013 but what makes it easy to drive is the fact that the car will select the most fuel-efficient way of powering the car, so the driver doesn\u2019t have to.\u201d\n\nMyth two: hybrids have to be plugged in\n\nSome hybrids are plug-ins, while others are not. Plug-in hybrids have batteries that can be charged from a power outlet and can run on electric power alone for between 30 and 40 miles, before needing the petrol or diesel engine to kick in. But hybrid technology is also available in cars such as the CR-V hybrid, which does not need to be plugged in. And with both types of hybrid, \u201crange anxiety\u201d isn\u2019t something you need to worry about \u2013 if the electrical energy runs out, they will shift over to the petrol or diesel engine.\n\nMyth three: hybrids are a cop-out. If we care about climate change we should be driving electric cars\n\nIn an ideal world, more of us would be driving electric cars. They have zero tailpipe emissions, so in terms of reducing CO 2 and combating climate change they\u2019re an excellent choice. But the fact is that electric vehicles aren\u2019t practical for many people \u2013 especially those who live in flats or terraced houses and don\u2019t have access to a charging point, or anyone who does a lot of long-distance driving.\n\nTim Anderson, head of transport at the Energy Saving Trust, says: \u201cFor motorists who don\u2019t have access to charging points, hybrids can be a worthwhile stepping stone towards reducing their CO 2 emissions. They are more energy-efficient than their petrol and diesel counterparts and are easy to buy, drive and live with.\u201d\n\nFrom family holidays to suburban commutes \u2013 why a hybrid SUV makes sense Read more\n\nMyth four: hybrids aren\u2019t fun to drive\n\nMotoring journalist Tim Barnes-Clay doesn\u2019t agree. \u201cEarly hybrids used to feel quite different from \u2018regular\u2019 cars, with a lack of connection with the driver\u2019s input and the vehicle\u2019s road behaviour. But now hybrids can be a joy to drive on any road, including motorways. For example, the Honda CR-V hybrid uses CVT automatic transmissions, giving a continuous flow of smooth power.\u201d\n\nMyth five: hybrids aren\u2019t very stylish\n\nWhen hybrids first came out about 20 years ago they did look quite quirky and different. \u201cHowever, designers have responded to what consumers want and hybrids are now styled to look as attractive as any other car,\u201d says Keith Adams, editor of car-buying website parkers.co.uk.\n\nMyth six: hybrids are too expensive\n\n\u201cAlthough hybrid cars cost a bit more than their petrol and diesel counterparts, their fuel economy means that savings can be made in running costs,\u201d says Adams. And with minimal running costs and excellent reliability, hybrids are in demand on the secondhand market and their resale value tends to be strong.\n\nMisconceptions about hybrids mean they can be seen as the worst of both worlds \u2013 not as green as electric cars, and less stylish and enjoyable to drive than conventional petrol or diesel vehicles. But for many motorists, they are the opposite, offering a practical and accessible way to reduce emissions while also being economical and fuss-free."}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/all-in-all-together/2020/jul/30/10-summer-wellness-ideas-for-you-and-your-family", "published": "2020-07-30T10:58:08", "title": "10 summer wellness ideas for you and your family", "text": "Wild swimming is excellent for boosting circulation. Photograph: AleksandarNakic/Getty Images\n\nThere\u2019s nothing like a global pandemic to make us re-evaluate what\u2019s really important in life and for many of us, it\u2019s our health. Tight restrictions on where we\u2019ve been able to go and what we\u2019ve been able to do have boosted the sales of fitness equipment as we\u2019ve looked for ways to stay in shape, while staying safe.\n\nFor many, this unprecedented situation has strained both our physical and mental wellbeing, but with lockdown measures easing and warmer weeks ahead, now is the time to renew good intentions and get more physically active.\n\n\u201cLockdown has knocked our health balance,\u201d says Claire Davis, a fitness coach at wellness retreat 38 Degrees North. \u201cWe\u2019ve eaten and drunk too much, exercised less than normal and succumbed to bad habits, increasing our stress levels. But summer is the ideal time to make healthy changes.\u201d\n\nSo whether your aim is to lose the odd lockdown pound, feel fitter or just stay strong enough to weather life\u2019s next big storm, this is the perfect time to make the changes you\u2019ve been daydreaming about.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A bit of canine company makes it a lot easier to get the kids out for a walk. Photograph: Pauline St.Denis/Getty Images/Tetra images RF\n\n1. Borrow a dog\n\nSpoiler alert: walking is perhaps the best exercise there is as it\u2019s low impact, can be done anywhere and almost anyone of any fitness level can get involved, for free.\n\nJust 15 minutes of moderate walking can see you cover about a mile\u2019s worth of ground, so it\u2019s easily one of the best ways to get out and get moving. Getting kids excited about going for a walk can be challenging, so why not lure them with the temptation of a furry friend for company? Borrow a neighbour\u2019s dog to take to the local park or check out dog-lending websites such as borrowmydoggy.com to find a pooch in your area that may need its legs stretching.\n\n2. Pick local produce\n\nBecause of lockdown, the pick-your-own season has had a bit of a slow start, but many farms have now applied social distancing measures and reopened for business. A morning or afternoon picking your own fruit and veg is not only wholesome family fun (whisper it: exercise), but it also supports local businesses, and ticks the environmentally friendly box as it means fresh groceries without all of the unnecessary shrink-wrap. A quick Google should help locate your local farms (or try pickyourownfarms.org.uk) and remember to call to check opening times and crop availability ahead of your visit.\n\n3. Go for a dip\n\nSummer is the perfect time for outdoor swimming, whether that\u2019s at your local lido (call and check that they\u2019ve reopened) or somewhere a little more wild. There\u2019s something extremely invigorating about braving the elements and swimming outdoors, and the UK is studded with rivers, lakes, ponds and beaches that are clean and safe to swim in.\n\nWild swimming is loaded with health benefits, from lowering stress hormones to improving circulation and reducing inflammation, plus a 30-minute session in cold water can burn almost 400 calories. Visit wildswimming.co.uk for locations close to you.\n\n4. Raise your voice\n\nPeople underestimate the fitness potential of a good old sing-song, but belting out a few tunes can burn calories, strengthen the diaphragm and pump more oxygen around the body than many other forms of aerobic exercise. It\u2019s also brilliant for mental health \u2013 reducing stress, boosting self-confidence and releasing endorphins.\n\nMost local choirs remain on hold due to Covid-19 but many are holding virtual sing-alongs (check out singforfun.co.uk).\n\n5. Hit the dance floor\n\nIt might be a while before nightclubs reopen, but dancing is a brilliant form of exercise and can be done right this second. Not only is dance a brilliant all-over aerobic workout, there is also a unique sense of freedom and empowerment that comes from moving your body to music, perfect for pepping yourself up post-lockdown.\n\nDance instructor Illana Gambrill was so overwhelmed by people desperate to get back to Dancebox \u2013 her Essex-based classes \u2013 that she\u2019s created a weekly online programme that is easy to sign up to, simple to follow and a bona fide saviour for mind, body and soul.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Picking your own veg is both eco-friendly and supports local businesses. Photograph: Getty Images/Cavan Images RF\n\n6. Eat alfresco\n\nWeather permitting, there is nothing more satisfying than sharing a meal with friends and family outdoors \u2013 the feelgood factor itself does much to boost our wellbeing. It is also thought to be of great benefit to children as outdoor eating \u2013 such as picnics and barbecues \u2013 often goes hand-in-hand with playdates and family bonding time. Fire up the coals or get a disposable barbecue to grill fish or lean cuts of meat such as chicken breasts or pork fillets, which are a healthier substitute for fatty burgers and sausages.\n\nExperiment with different marinades and simple side salads, invite some friends and don\u2019t forget your brolly for the quintessential British experience. Fingers crossed you won\u2019t need it.\n\n7. Learn to hula\n\nHula hooping might conjure up visions of 1980s lycra-clad fitness types, or seem more like vintage child\u2019s play, but it can actually burn as much fat as treadmill exercises, and other benefits include toning muscles and strengthening your heart.\n\nAdvocates reckon that 10 minutes of hula-ing a day will see results and the plastic hoop should only set you back a couple of quid from a general store (although if you\u2019re feeling fancy, a weighted one can be purchased for less than the cost of your average round at the pub). With minimal kit required and plenty of tutorials available online, this is an amazing way to start getting active again after the long lockdown break.\n\n8. Go geocaching\n\nImagine that you could be a part of the world\u2019s biggest treasure hunt the moment you step out your door. Geocaching is exactly that. This free outdoor activity is suitable for all ages and uses the GPS on your smartphone to allow you to hide and seek secret containers at specific locations, marked by coordinates all over the world.\n\nGetting you out and about, turning you into real-life Lara Crofts \u2013 this is a brilliantly fun activity for the whole family. And with more than 3m caches to find, there\u2019s bound to be something to sniff out near you. Register for a free basic membership at geocaching.com.\n\nFrom the Black Mountains to the north Pennines: four crowd-free UK summer destinations Read more\n\n9. Get out in the garden\n\nThere is increasing evidence that gardening provides substantial health benefits \u2013 just interacting with flora lowers our cortisol, improving mood and mental health. You can also burn about 330 calories doing one hour of light gardening, plus when you\u2019re outdoors your body makes vitamin D, which strengthens bones, although you should still apply sunscreen.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have a garden, search online for a local community gardening initiative; failing that, plant some salad leaves in indoor pots. Growing your own food helps children develop a lasting habit of eating fresh vegetables and might make them more likely to try new (green) things.\n\n10. Walk and work\n\nFor many, lockdown has forced us to re-evaluate the way we work, revealing our astounding ability to multitask. So post lockdown, consider the ways in which you could make your regular working day that bit more active.\n\nNeed to schedule a 30-minute meeting? Do what Steve Jobs was fond of and have a walking meeting instead. Or if somebody wants to meet up to talk business over coffee, suggest making it a takeaway and having a stroll. You can also extend these multitasking habits outside of work hours with a spot of \u201ctemptation bundling\u201d \u2013 pairing something you love with an activity you\u2019re trying to do more of. Make sitting in a squat while binge-watching box-sets the new normal.\n\nThis advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

He replied immediately, enabling her daughter to complete the task. Brown was impressed \u2013 it felt like one-to-one tutoring, but Daisy was attending school online via her Microsoft Surface, studying from the family\u2019s kitchen table.\n\nBefore the school closures, it was impossible to imagine children decamping from classrooms to embark on online learning, and harder still to picture parents as proxy teachers. Yet for Brown and other parents, this is the new normal. Technology is making it possible; allowing teaching to continue uninterrupted, enhancing students\u2019 creativity, productivity and collaboration, and enabling parents to engage with their children\u2019s learning journey.\n\nBrown works as a support staff member at her daughter\u2019s school, and considers the school\u2019s remote-learning provision the silver lining to the cloud that is the current crisis. \u201cDaisy joins her form group every morning via video link, then follows her normal timetable \u2013 it\u2019s working fantastically,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s lovely to hear her classmates chatting away and helping one another with their work.\u201d\n\nDistance learning isn\u2019t new. But the pandemic has drastically accelerated the development of online education, and technology is at the forefront of this modern educational reform. Microsoft Teams \u2013 used in 175 countries by 183,000 institutions \u2013 is equipping students with a learning environment that is accessible, inclusive and collaborative.\n\nFor parents thrust into the role of home educator, it\u2019s natural to feel anxious. But supporting your child\u2019s online education doesn\u2019t mean replicating the school environment. Melanie Dalpra from Reading, whose daughter, Maia, is in year 11, says: \u201cEven Maia\u2019s school isn\u2019t trying to replicate it \u2013 she has three 45-minute online lessons and the rest of her day is given to independent study.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s a really good model \u2013 don\u2019t let Covid-19 push your child out of the centre of their education.\u201d\n\nSafeguarding is also a key consideration for parents. As education moves online and children rely on technology tools for learning, parents need peace of mind that the devices they use are equipped with world-class security measures. Microsoft offers tools for every task with security built in, from chip to cloud.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest For many parents, becoming a proxy teacher is the new normal\n\nA particular advantage of Windows 10 Pro is its inbuilt security solution, including streamlined security updates, safe searches and no retargeting of students with online adverts \u2013 features parents may already be familiar with through the tools they use at work. Microsoft 365 allows users to move seamlessly and securely from one device to another without complexity.\n\nFor home-learning to be effective, Ciaran O\u2019Halloran, head of drama at Our Lady and St Patrick\u2019s college in Knock, Belfast, recommends focusing on healthy routines rather than slavishly following the school timetable. \u201cA lot of the things that happen in school happen in order to manage hundreds of people effectively,\u201d he says. \u201cWe spend a lot of time organising and socialising children so they can function in the school environment but without that, parents can be much more responsive.\u201d\n\nParents who want to support their child\u2019s online learning do not need in-depth knowledge of the topics their child is studying, either. \u201cI certainly don\u2019t know everything and my kids know that,\u201d laughs Dalpra. \u201cYou\u2019re not an encyclopaedia; we look things up together and they\u2019re learning to ask for help, which is a really useful life skill.\u201d\n\nWith so little time to prepare for online learning, many households find themselves sharing limited resources. But Microsoft apps have the advantage of being accessible on all devices \u2013 meaning students can begin work in one place and move to another device seamlessly as required, reducing pressure on the main family device.\n\n\u201cMicrosoft apps don\u2019t necessarily require children to work within them,\u201d says O\u2019Halloran. \u201cA screenshot of task instructions on Teams can be viewed on a phone.\u201d\n\nEquipping young learners with tools that enhance productivity and enable collaboration in this way \u2013 at the same time as encouraging them to flex their creativity \u2013 is key to developing the cognitive and problem-solving skills that will benefit them throughout life.\n\nCould the lockdown change the way we teach forever? Read more\n\nFor some children, online learning offers unexpected respite from the challenges of going to school. Dalpra, whose three children have Asperger syndrome, ADHD and dyspraxia respectively, says quarantine can create opportunities to reconsider your child\u2019s needs. \u201cOne of the advantages of online learning is that you can control sensory stimulus and adapt learning materials to suit the needs of individual learners,\u201d she says.\n\nAn inclusive learning experience is vital for all young people. Giving your child access to tools that include special features to address a range of individual needs is essential, especially for those with specific learning needs. Free accessibility tools \u2013 such as Immersive Reader \u2013 are built in to all Microsoft products to help empower students of all abilities to learn without stigma and at their own pace. Immersive Reader provides a full-screen reading experience, designed to increase readability of text \u2013 students can change spacing, read text aloud, and sound out words by syllable.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to imagine schools reverting to business as usual, and the new educational landscape will surely continue posing challenges for parents. But whatever the future holds, the technology is on their side. For parents worried about how to adapt and survive, Dalpra has a pearl of wisdom: \u201cChildren develop if they\u2019re in a nourishing environment, and just feeling heard can transform a child\u2019s education.\u201d\n\nFive tips to support online education\n\n1. Put mental health and wellbeing above academic progress. If learning isn\u2019t going well, play a board game or go for a walk together and revisit the task later. The Do Not Disturb function in Teams can also help with children\u2019s concentration.\n\n2. Have fun. This is a difficult time for children, but learning should be enjoyable.\n\n3. Encourage your child to ask teachers for help \u2013 not all children are used to doing so.\n\n4. Stick to a daily routine but allow time for play, relaxation and boredom.\n\n5. Remember that you\u2019re dealing with a person, not just a student. Show your child that you\u2019re still learning too, and approach it together.\n\nInterested in finding out more about how to support your child\u2019s online learning experience?

As restaurants closed, the wholesale arm of the business disappeared, and he had no idea what was going to happen to his four shops or his market stalls across Norwich and Aylsham. \u201cAt that point there was no furlough scheme. All I was trying to do was pay my 30 staff,\u201d Winter says.\n\nThe response to the new website, which launched at the start of April, blew him away. \u201cIn the first week or two, we were up to 200 orders a day,\u201d he says. \u201cWe sold 10,000 loaves, 25,000 pastries and 10 tonnes of flour online over two months.\u201d The team expanded their range to include other staples such as eggs, milk, butter and coffee, which were dropped off to customers across Norfolk using the bakery\u2019s two delivery vans.\n\nAnthony Fletcher, chief executive of Graze, has been paired with Steven Winter.\n\nWinter was also mindful of making good food available to his hospitality colleagues, many of whom had lost their jobs. He introduced a National Loaf scheme, inspired by a product conceived by the Federation of Bakers in 1942 to keep the country fed during the second world war. Today, Winter is selling the nutritious loaf for \u00a31 and he is now hoping to expand the initiative nationwide.\n\nThe Bread Source is not alone in exploring online channels for the first time. Research by the Federation of Small Businesses has found that 16% of SMEs developed a new website or increased their online presence because of lockdown. A GoDaddy survey also found that one in five microbusinesses (those with fewer than nine employees) have set up online for the first time in the past three months, and almost all (82%) say they will maintain their digital presence in the future.\n\nSakshi Anand, senior director for GoDaddy UK, says Covid-19 has provided many small businesses with the impetus to get online, driving what\u2019s becoming known as a second digital revolution: \u201cOne of the biggest barriers is people think it\u2019s really complicated\u201d, she says about launching a website. \u201cMost microbusiness owners run finance, the technology and marketing, they\u2019re doing everything. But once you start seeing sales coming or you see other businesses who are thriving from it, you realise it\u2019s something you definitely need. And with GoDaddy\u2019s drag-and-drop marketing tools, you can have a fully functioning website online in 24-48 hours.\u201d\n\nFor Winter, it\u2019s been transformational \u2013 the online demand covered the sales the bakery would have made if it had been business as usual. He\u2019s keen to make the business\u2019s digital channel a permanent feature, and will be using this opportunity to develop an email marketing campaign for the 5,000 customers on the bakery\u2019s database, experiment with pay-per-click (PPC) advertising, and explore widening its audience beyond the local market. He\u2019ll be supported by Rosie Mills-Smith, Bread Source\u2019s marketing lead, GoDaddy Guides \u2013 a 6,000-strong team providing bespoke support to small business owners \u2013 and a suite of digital tools. He and Mills-Smith are mindful of the need to scale their new retail channel in a sustainable way. \u201cI think probably the hardest thing has been going from dealing with three or four enquiries a day on social media and via email, to literally thousands more,\u201d says Mills-Smith.\n\nIn Bath, yoga and meditation teacher Lucy Stone has been inspired to launch her new website because of the popularity of her free guided meditation videos, posted on Facebook during the pandemic. \u201cWhen I started there were 10 or 15 people and then each video was getting 1,000 views. It was amazing,\u201d she says.\n\nMeditation Rocks is the third business for Stone, who also runs Yogadoo, providing yoga classes for children at school, and The Hive yoga studio. Although the yoga studio has been offering classes online during lockdown, it was the demand for meditation guidance that skyrocketed and made Stone realise she should launch her own separate offering. \u201cThey were massively outperforming yoga, by around 400%,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd it was mostly people trying meditation for the first time \u2026 seeking out ways to look after themselves.\u201d\n\nNadia Narain is Lucy Stone\u2019s mentor\n\nShe\u2019ll now work with GoDaddy\u2019s Guides to design and launch a dedicated website for Meditation Rocks. She plans to provide guided meditation for children and adults via free videos, and to offer more in-depth courses, for which she\u2019ll charge. She\u2019s also open to the idea of launching a blog and adding an online shop to sell merchandise.\n\nOne of the challenges she knows she\u2019ll face in growing her brand is attracting new customers, and dealing with the image of meditation. \u201cYoga has come a long way in the past 15 years or so, it\u2019s become very cool,\u201d she says. \u201cMeditation is still playing catch up \u2026 there\u2019s a lot of misunderstanding about what it is and what it does.\u201d\n\nBut she won\u2019t be alone as she makes plans for Meditation Rocks. To help Stone and, indeed, Steven Winter at Bread Source to nail their digital futures, we\u2019ve paired each of them with a mentor who can offer expert advice.\n\nStone will be supported by yoga and meditation teacher Nadia Narain. With a client list that has included Rachel Weisz, Kate Moss, Jools Oliver, and the Arsenal football team, Narain has been teaching yoga since 1996. She was one of Triyoga\u2019s original teachers when the studio opened in London in 2000. She is also an author, has a range of DVDs, developed her own perfume and aromatherapy candles, and recently launched an online course promoting self care during lockdown, with her sister Katia.\n\n\u201cI always think of yoga as my love,\u201d says Narain. \u201cAnd I\u2019m so lucky that I get to do it.\u201d She enjoys mentoring other teachers and says monetisation is something a lot of people ask her about.\n\n\u201cThe thing I feel I do the best with teachers is to bring out their voice. That authenticity is super important. All you can do is bring the deepest, most authentic part of yourself [to class] and let that shine through.\u201d\n\nThe mentor paired with Winter is Anthony Fletcher, chief executive of Graze. He has led the healthy-snacks company for the past seven years, as it expanded into markets such as the US, Ireland and the Netherlands, and into UK retail outlets including Boots, WH Smith and Waitrose.\n\nToday it has a 200,000-strong subscriber base, and a product range of 400 different snack combinations. Fletcher believes it\u2019s the ideal time for small, local businesses to make an impact online, even if they\u2019re working with limited budgets. \u201cWhen Graze started [in 2008] it cost big bucks to do what we did. But a lot of that cost has gone away. You can now do quite sophisticated things very cheaply and without a lot of technical knowledge.\n\n\u201cThe wonderful thing about digital is it\u2019s intuitive,\u201d he adds. \u201cSo go and spend \u00a320 on marketing. If it works well, spend \u00a340 the next day. If nothing resonates, maybe you change things around and try something a bit different ... The obvious advantage that small businesses have is agility, and the ability to set off in a new direction. But I think we\u2019ve crossed the Rubicon with Covid-19. People want to buy local, people want to know who\u2019s behind the business. They\u2019ll back you if they buy into who you are and what you\u2019re trying to do.\u201d\n\nAnand agrees, citing GoDaddy research that found 63% of customers say they\u2019re more likely to shop at small local businesses during the pandemic, and 67% of those intend to continue doing so in the future. \u201cMore now than ever, people have realised the importance of supporting small businesses,\u201d she says. \u201cThat community spirit has really shone through this crisis.\u201d\n\nGoDaddy launched the #OpenWeStand initiative offering a number of free tools, widgets, resources and blogposts at OpenWeStand.org to help small businesses keep their digital doors open while their physical doors are closed. Over 50 companies have joined the cause, including Slack, Salesforce, PayPal, and more"}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/aug/05/how-to-make-the-perfect-russian-salad-felicity-cloake", "published": "2020-08-05T11:00:29", "title": "How to make the perfect Russian salad | Felicity Cloake's The perfect\u2026", "text": "Spuds, boiled eggs, runner beans, mayo \u2013 and always, always ham ... or not.

Richard Corrigan\u2019s Russian salad. Thumbnails by Felicity Cloake.\n\nIn Russia itself, as in Iran, this mixture of cooked, diced vegetables in a creamy dressing is named after Lucien Olivier, the Belgian chef who first put it on the menu at his Moscow restaurant in the mid-19th century. According to Darra Goldstein\u2019s classic work A Taste of Russia, Olivier\u2019s original was a mixture \u201cof cooked chicken and potatoes masked with mayonnaise\u201d, but if that is indeed the case, it wasn\u2019t long before it traded up: Escoffier\u2019s 1903 recipe contains lobster, truffles and caviar. Modern-day Russian salad seems to have almost as many variations as it has fans. But what\u2019s the best?\n\nThe vegetables\n\nThough many mass-produced versions go big on the spuds, this shouldn\u2019t be a potato salad with benefits \u2013 if Russian salad is an orchestra of flavours and textures, then each player deserves to be heard. That said, we miss them in Richard Corrigan\u2019s salad (which, to be fair to him, is intended to be served with a potato pancake) \u2013 their starchy bulk feels like a good anchor, turning the salad from a mere vegetable sideshow into a dish in its own right.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Apple, sweetcorn, soft white beans: Ren Behan\u2019s Russian salad.\n\nI do, however, enjoy the turnips Corrigan uses instead, writing in The Clatter of Forks and Spoons, \u201cI like that little bitterness in your mouth to offset the sweetness of some of the other vegetables \u2026 we don\u2019t have enough bitterness going on in our cooking overall.\u201d Sweet, in his case, means carrots, which are present in every recipe I try, and beetroot, which is used less often. Though the latter is indeed sweet, it presents the salad maker with a practical problem in that it bleeds its sweet purple juices into everything else, muddying the flavours as well as the colours. If you do use it, I would, like Corrigan, recommend plonking it on top just before serving.\n\nPeas are another favourite, and add a pleasing spherical element to all those little cubes (dicing the vegetables is the hardest part of this recipe: as Siberian-born Alissa Timoshkina observes in her book Salt and Time, \u201cthe cooking method for this salad could not be simpler, yet also more time-consuming\u201d); though, since mushy peas are only delicious on a fish supper, I\u2019d suggest pouring a kettle of boiling water over them rather than simmering them with the other vegetables, so they retain their characteristic springy freshness.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Halved boiled eggs and a light dressing: Alissa Timoshkina\u2019s Russian salad.\n\nYou could leave it there, but I also like the snap of the lightly cooked French beans in a couple of the recipes I try \u2013 testers, meanwhile, are very keen on the crispness of the apple with the sweetcorn and soft white beans in Ren Behan\u2019s Polish version in Wild Honey and Rye. Cauliflower seems to be popular in Italian translations, Lindsey Bareham and Simon Hopkinson\u2019s version in the Prawn Cocktail Years includes cooked celery or celeriac, and Nieves Barrag\u00e1n Mohacho (who says in her book Sabor that she\u2019s never met a Spanish person who doesn\u2019t love ensaladilla rusa) piles hers on to little gem lettuce leaves and garnishes it with white asparagus and piquillo peppers.\n\nIn short, so long as you aim for a harmonious mixture of flavours and textures, and stick with cooked vegetables (this is not, I think, a place for the juicy crunch of the raw), use what you like \u2013 early recipes seem more focused on protein, in any case. Whatever you go for, having made six of the things in quick succession, I\u2019d agree with chef Trish Hilferty in her excellent book of fish and potato recipes, Lobster and Chips: \u201cIt\u2019s important to cook the vegetables separately and in strict order,\u201d rather than putting them all in the same pan and hoping for the best. Unless time is of the essence, I\u2019d do the chopping afterwards \u2013 unless you watch them like a hawk, it\u2019s easy to overcook diced vegetables.\n\nThe not-vegetables\n\nTimoshkina notes that, although she prefers to keep her salad vegetarian, millions of Russians disagree, so she suggests adding diced cooked chicken breast to the mix, while one of my testers, who boasts extensive experience of the dish \u201cmade by actual Russians\u201d, claims she\u2019s never had one without ham. The Prawn Cocktail Years recipe, based on that by Escoffier, the great French chef and cookery writer of the late-19th century, includes that, but also tongue, lobster and, \u201cif throwing caution to the wind\u201d, caviar (or anchovies, should caution be something you wish to keep a firm hold on).\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Celery and sausage: Lindsey Bareham and Simon Hopkinson\u2019s Russian salad.\n\nBareham and Hopkinson further note that Larousse Gastronomique calls for sausage, and Silvena Rowe suggests frankfurters, while Hilferty adds peeled brown shrimps, which have a salty sweetness that meets with a mixed reception from my testers \u2013 \u201cThis tastes like the 70s,\u201d one says, rather unkindly. Though I defend them (none of us knows what the 1907s tasted like, but I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s not delicious Morecambe Bay shrimp), I have to concede that, like the caviar, they do tend to dominate every mouthful they\u2019re part of.\n\nThe lobster, meanwhile, suffers from the opposite problem: despite offering a pleasingly meaty texture, with everything else going on here, its flavour gets a bit lost. Unless you\u2019re lucky enough to live somewhere where it\u2019s cheap as chips, I\u2019d save fancy seafood for a dish where it can be the star of the show \u2013 and anyway, the bolder flavours of the salted meat seem to work better with the sweetness of the vegetables and creaminess of the dressing in this dish.\n\nIf you want to keep the salad meat-free, you may be pleased to learn that hard-boiled eggs are, in my opinion, a non-negotiable ingredient. The bouncy whites and rich, crumbly yolks bring yet another texture to the party \u2013 if you\u2019re serving the salad as a standalone dish, you might prefer, as Timoshkina suggests, to serve them cut in half on top instead. (You could, of course, leave them out entirely, and use vegan mayonnaise, to make an entirely plant-based version.)\n\nOf pickles and herbs\n\nThe one strong flavour we do (almost) all vote for is pickled cucumbers, which feel like a quintessentially Russian ingredient, offering pops of vinegary flavour without overpowering the creaminess of the dressing. The capers in the Prawn Cocktail Years\u2019 recipe do much the same job for salt, making both optional, but recommended.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Felicity Cloake\u2019s hybrid Russian salad.\n\nHerbs aren\u2019t a big part of this particular salad, and indeed many recipes don\u2019t include any at all. Dill is a common choice among those that do, while Corrigan takes that \u201cslightly liquorice\u201d flavour even further with tarragon, and the Prawn Cocktail Years suggests chives, which offer a more subtle flavour than Hilferty\u2019s spring onion; again, the aim here is that no one ingredient should overwhelm the rest. Personally, I like dill, but chives are a happy alternative for those, like some of my testers, who are sworn against the stuff. (If you want to go really wild, note that Ghayour uses coriander in the version in her book Persiana.)\n\nThe dressing\n\nThough Timoshkina describes Olivier as a stalwart of the Soviet repertoire of \u201csalads heavily laden with mayo\u201d, she herself favours a lighter dressing of creme fraiche and yoghurt; Hilferty mixes mayonnaise with soured cream, and Corrigan rebels entirely: \u201cThe French laugh at things like salad cream,\u201d he observes, \u201cbut they have their own kind of salad cream in mayonnaise. I think the idea of a homemade salad cream \u2026 is terrific, I really do.\u201d My testers also like the idea, and the reality of it, too, especially as made to his recipe, with English mustard and evaporated milk, though they\u2019re less keen on it in this particular dish, preferring the richness of straight mayonnaise to any of the alternatives.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mayo and soured cream? Trish Hilferty\u2019s Russian salad.\n\nYou don\u2019t need too much of it, though; just enough lightly to coat the rest, rather than turning it into a claggy mess of unidentifiable ingredients, preferably with a dash of pickle juice or some other acid to pep things up a bit. Not too much, however; in this salad, moderation is everything \u2013 until it comes to helping yourself, obviously.\n\nPerfect Russian salad\n\nPrep 40 min\n\nCook 15 min\n\nServes 4\n\nFor the homemade mayonnaise (alternatively, use 2-3 tbsp ready-made)\n\n2 egg yolks\n\n1 tsp dijon mustard\n\n1 generous pinch salt\n\n250ml groundnut or sunflower oil\n\n25ml extra-virgin olive oil\n\n1 tbsp white-wine vinegar, or lemon juice\n\nFor the salad\n\n200g waxy potatoes (ie, about 4 small ones)\n\n100g carrots (ie, 1 medium one)\n\n100g turnip (about half a medium one, or 2 extra potatoes, if you prefer)\n\n50g green beans\n\n75g frozen peas\n\n2 eggs\n\n2 large gherkins, plus 2 tbsp of their pickling liquid\n\n1 tbsp salted capers, rinsed\n\n50g ham or tongue (optional)\n\n1 small bunch dill or chives, finely chopped\n\nTo make the mayonnaise, beat the egg yolks and mustard in a large bowl until thickened (it\u2019s helpful to anchor the bowl by putting a damp tea towel underneath it), then gradually whisk in the oils, very slowly at first. Finally, stir in the vinegar and season to taste. (This will make too much mayonnaise, but it keeps well in the fridge.)\n\nPeel the potatoes, carrot and turnip, if using, and top and tail the beans. Cut the carrot and turnip into large chunks, but keep the potatoes whole, unless they\u2019re particularly large.\n\nPut the potatoes in a pan of cold salted water, bring to a boil and cook until tender; be careful not to overcook them, or they\u2019ll be hard to cut neatly later.\n\nMeanwhile, bring another pan of salted water to a boil, cook the beans for a couple of minutes until al dente, then scoop out with a slotted spoon into a sink or large bowl filled with cold water.\n\nPut the carrot and turnip in the same pot of boiling water and cook until tender, checking both regularly, because they\u2019ll probably be done at different times, then scoop out and add to the beans bowl. Put the peas in a colander, pour a kettle of boiling water over them, then put with the rest of the vegetables.\n\nBoil the egg for eight and a half minutes, then leave to cool while you drain, dry and chop the vegetables (except the peas) into 1cm dice and put them all in a large bowl. Cut the gherkins into 1cm dice and add to the bowl with two tablespoons of their pickling vinegar, the capers and peas.\n\nCut the ham into strips and add to the bowl with the herbs. Peel and grate in the eggs. Finally, stir in the mayonnaise and serve \u2013 it\u2019s even better after a few hours in the fridge, though.\n\n\u2022 Russian salad, salat Olivier, salad Olivieh \u2026 whatever you call it, is it a nostalgic pleasure, a current favourite, or something that once came out of tins and is now best forgotten? What do you put in yours and, just as importantly, what do you serve it with? And why oh why is the UK one of the few European countries to spurn its mayonnaisey charms?\n\n\n\n"}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/aug/05/sun-sea-seafood-and-few-covid-cases-summer-in-southern-puglia", "published": "2020-08-05T05:30:22", "title": "Sun, sea, seafood \u2026 and few Covid cases: summer in southern Puglia", "text": "Gilda Siena likes to talk \u2013 so much so she is known among her guests as \u201cthe chatty woman\u201d.\n\nIn the decade since she bought a 19th-century building once inhabited by Venetian nobility in the Salento area \u2013 at the southern tip (the heel) of Italy\u2019s Puglia region \u2013 and made it into boutique hotel Palazzo Siena-Home & More, this aspect of her personality has led to many friendships.\n\nProof of the affection felt towards her can be gleaned from the message book and thank you letters and cards received from around the world. Among her favourite guests are the Swiss man who she nicknamed \u201cJames Bond\u201d for his flash white sports car (which looked a tad out of place in the hamlet of Specchia Gallone, especially alongside her Mini Metro); the interior designer from London; the couple who asked her to witness their wedding; and the six lesbians from Canada who she hung out with by the pool, chatting and laughing.\n\n\u201cThose women were such great fun,\u201d said the 61-year-old. \u201cThe most beautiful thing about this job is getting to know people.\u201d\n\nBut this year, owing to the coronavirus pandemic, there are few people to chat to.\n\n\u201cIt is a strange year, and sad to see something that was so lively now so quiet. We were like one big family,\u201d said Gilda, whose two daughters help her manage the business when they can.\n\nGilda in the palazzo kitchen\n\nAlthough tourism has been returning to Italy since the country reopened its borders in early June, and the coronavirus situation is relatively under control, bookings are drastically down. The increase in the number of Italians holidaying at home has done little to diminish the impact of the loss of income from foreign visitors. Italy is the fifth most-visited country in the world, and tourism usually accounts for 13% of GDP, or about \u20ac230bn a year.\n\n\u201cWe were fully booked for the season by January: many people were returning guests, but then they cancelled their bookings because of the pandemic,\u201d said Gilda.\n\nFor Palazzo Siena, as with other hotels that have reopened, trying to stay afloat has meant reducing prices. The season began late because of the national lockdown. The pricing strategy prompted a trickle of bookings in June and July; August is looking more promising. Another selling point is that Salento and the wider Puglia region have been fairly unscathed by Covid-19, with fewer than 5,000 confirmed cases since the onset of the pandemic in February.\n\nThe majority of Palazzo Siena\u2019s guests usually come from the UK, the US and Canada. This year, the foreign visitors who have made the journey so far are from neighbouring countries.\n\nAustrian Sylvia Fragapane, her Italian husband Fabio, and their daughter drove 14 hours from their home in Switzerland and booked a three-night stay at Palazzo Siena. It was the family\u2019s first visit to Puglia.\n\n\u201cWe chose Puglia because there are few Covid cases,\u201d Sylvia said. \u201cAnd we were careful when picking a place to stay \u2013 we could tell Palazzo Siena was a beautiful home to stay in, nice and spacious and unlike normal hotels.\u201d\n\nThe interior of Palazzo Siena\n\nPalazzo Siena is somewhat of an oasis amid a pandemic. The building, once owned by a family of rich merchants, had lain abandoned since the 1960s before Gilda caught wind that it was for sale during a conversation with a fellow diner at a pizzeria in nearby Otranto, while on holiday there in 2010.\n\n\u201cIt was destroyed, but as soon as the door opened it hit me how beautiful it was,\u201d said Gilda, who had never undertaken a project of its kind before. After a brief tussle with another keen buyer, the property was hers.\n\nIt took a year to restore. Customers soon started to arrive, mostly by word of mouth. The nine airy rooms are impeccably furnished, retaining the building\u2019s original features. Guests fall asleep to nothing but the sound of chirping crickets and wake up to the sound of church bells. Centuries-old vines cover the ancient colonnade in the vast garden, which is home to fig, walnut and almond trees. The vegetable patch provides ingredients Gilda uses in local dishes, including pumpkin flower risotto with burrata, the mozzarella-like cheese from Puglia, and courgette tart. While there\u2019s no restaurant as such, meals can be ordered in advance and served either on the terrace or in the dining room.\n\nThe pool \u2013 which is cleaned by the same person who cleans the pool at the holiday home of actress Helen Mirren in Miggiano, about a half hour\u2019s drive away \u2013 offers respite from the afternoon heat.\n\n\u201cThis is a holiday for people who want peace and to relax,\u201d said Gilda. \u201cMany wake up early, to swim and do some exercise. There are lots of quiet spots to read. There are walking and bike trails nearby. People don\u2019t have to think about dressing up or putting on makeup. For me, this is the real Salento \u2013 simplicity.\u201d\n\nSpecchia Gallone is a neat hamlet of fewer than 500 people, with little entertainment beyond a bar and restaurant. It can be reached by car from Brindisi airport, or by once-daily bus from the baroque city of Lecce, from where you can catch a train to the nearby town of Poggiardo. However, a car is essential for exploring the pristine beaches and remote villages of the Salento.\n\nPorto Badisco is 20-minutes away by car, though its beach is small. Photograph: Angela Giuffrida\n\nThe closest beach to Specchia Gallone, a 20-minute drive away, is Porto Badisco, an inlet with a small sandy beach and rocks from which local youth plunge into the clear water. As legend would have it, the Trojan hero Aeneas made a stopover in Porto Badisco after his escape from Troy.\n\nOn a recent Thursday morning, the beach was packed, with little social distancing in evidence.\n\n\u201cFewer people are coming but it\u2019s still impossible to find a parking space,\u201d said resident Gino Castaldi.\n\nThe beachgoers are mostly locals and other Italians on holiday.\n\n\u201cI usually like to travel abroad, but this year I\u2019m discovering Italy more,\u201d said Claudio Ressa, an IT specialist from Milan, in Lombardy, the region worst-affected by coronavirus. \u201cThe situation in Milan was so heavy. But here I feel relaxed, as there are not so many cases. The people are also welcoming.\u201d\n\nMore breathing space can be found in Alimini, north of Otranto, where a long stretch of beach is backed by sand dunes and pinewoods. Most of the beach is taken up by private establishments, with lounger and umbrella rental for about \u20ac8 a day. The beach businesses must follow strict coronavirus rules, including maintaining adequate space between loungers and disinfecting the beds between customers.\n\nAlimini beach is sandy and spacious. Photograph: Angela Giuffrida\n\n\u201cThe season is slowly getting started, but with a reduction of 30% or 40% compared with previous summers,\u201d said Enrico Castellano, who manages the Due Laghi beach club. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of British people visiting over the past 10 years, but not so many now. I hope they return. It\u2019s a beautiful region, full of nature and well-serviced tourism.\u201d\n\nSalento\u2019s economy was once fuelled by the tobacco industry, but all that remains today of that era are abandoned factories. Olive oil is a major product, but growers have been badly affected by another infectious disease \u2013 Xylella fastidiosa \u2013 a plant pathogen that has killed tens of thousands of olive trees in recent years. That leaves the region heavily dependent on tourism. Villages would usually draw visitors through cultural events and sagre, food festivals showcasing local specialities. But these have mostly been cancelledthis year.\n\n\u201cIt all went up in smoke,\u201d said Remo De Pascalis, a bakery owner in Giuggianello, close to Specchia Gallone. \u201cAll the women usually collaborate to make traditional dishes. Sagre bring small communities together but also attract plenty of tourists \u2013 they are the event of the year.\u201d\n\nRestaurants, especially those with ample outdoor space, are managing to hold up.\n\n\u201cWe lost April and May in the lockdown but since we reopened in early June, there has been a steady flow of people,\u201d said Barbara Vincenti, co-owner of Matisse, a restaurant in Uggiano la Chiesa, near Specchia Gallone and recommended for its seafood. \u201cWe have a garden so we manage to distance the tables well. For the moment, we are not doing too badly. But I worry about the winter, as people might not want to eat inside. Plus, we don\u2019t know what awaits us with the virus.\u201d\n\nThe season at Palazzo Siena wraps up in October, when Gilda returns to her home in Bari. She\u2019s not expecting much from the next few months, but hopes to see her friends return in 2021.\n\n\u201cThis year has been different,\u201d she said. \u201cI just hope that nothing else happens and that we can soon get back to normal.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Palazzo Siena has a special rate of \u20ac190 a night for its comfort rooms in August and September (normal rates in August from \u20ac223-\u20ac366). In October, comfort rooms cost \u20ac139 and suites \u20ac179, palazzosiena.com"}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/aug/05/mi-pan-su-su-su-how-a-dancing-llama-and-a-nonsensical-song-captivated-tiktok", "published": "2020-08-05T04:02:39", "title": "Mi pan, su su su: how a dancing llama and a nonsensical song captivated TikTok", "text": "There are only two types of people in this world.

She asks interested parties to submit their stories based on a theme of her collections \u2013 which run from the problem of perfectionism to what a loving relationship looks like now.

While this could sound like marketing speak, the stories themselves are far from it. Naomi speaks out about abuse, Roisin gives her thoughts on gender roles, Mary and Lily discuss polyamory.

While it might be seen as a cynical ploy to sell bras in a post-#MeToo world, other brands are effecting change. Ciss\u00e9 agrees that Savage x Fenty \u2013 launched by Rihanna in 2018, with a show that included plus size models, Joan Smalls and a nine-months-pregnant Slick Woods \u2013 has a genuinely \u201cbody positive\u201d and diverse point of view. \u201cI don\u2019t think their approach was based on something commercial,\u201d says Ciss\u00e9. \u201cIt was just the way it should be and it made a lot of sense for that brand.\u201d Like The Underargument, Savage x Fenty has been consistent with this diverse casting in their imagery \u2013 albeit using professional models rather than casting through submissions.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Burberry\u2019s spring/summer 2021 pre-collection.

Brands including Eckhaus Latta and Marques\u2019Almeida have consistently used \u201cstreet casting\u201d with nonprofessional models walking in their catwalk shows. And Theface.com has mooted the idea of the \u201cno-del\u201d. This is based Gucci and Burberry using their own design teams instead of professional models for pre-collections released in July \u2013 possibly because, with a pandemic, it\u2019s more tricky to fly Gigi Hadid in for the day.\n\nBurberry\u2019s images feature Massimo, an accessories designer, in a jumper on his doorstep in Hackney and Sabine, from the art direction department, wearing a smart suit in Ladbroke Grove. A more everyday, relatable reality is presented rather than fashion as fantasy. As nice as it is to think this is about big global brands discovering their warm fuzzy side in lockdown, it\u2019s also a savvy shift to the mood of the moment. \u201cPerhaps normies can help us, mere mortals, to connect more emotionally to the clothes,\u201d writes Max Berlinger for Theface.com.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Gucci\u2019s spring/summer 2021 pre-collection.

They had been dating for two and half years but didn\u2019t share a home. Now, forced to choose between not seeing each other for weeks on end, or being together 24/7, he had opted for separation.\n\n\u201cAt first, I felt anxious about being apart,\u201d she recalls. But friends reassured her that it was only natural not to want to start living together in such stressful circumstances. \u201cWe are both very young, in our early 20s, so I brushed aside my concerns and we went to stay separately with our families.\u201d\n\nThough they had agreed to speak regularly, Hannah quickly noticed they were drifting apart. \u201cLockdown days felt like Groundhog Day, where we were both doing the same boring stuff, and conversations got quite tedious,\u201d she explains.\n\nThey started to argue about everything, especially politics. \u201cI\u2019ve felt disappointed by the government\u2019s response to lockdown, but he wasn\u2019t bothered. That sort of thing really weighed on my mind as I have friends who have been directly affected by Covid.\u201d After six weeks, they found themselves barely speaking. \u201cI realised I didn\u2019t miss him or being around him. I missed my friends a lot more.\u201d\n\nThe couple broke up over the phone, which she says was \u201ceasier\u201d than a video call. \u201cI didn\u2019t want him to see me cry. I actually preferred breaking up in lockdown, as I was able to think clearly and distract myself by being with my family.\u201d\n\nYou tend to find that older couples have been together much longer and weathered more storms Psychotherapist Gin Lalli\n\nAccording to research by relationship support charity Relate, Hannah\u2019s situation is not unusual. In April, almost a quarter of couples (23%) said they were struggling with their relationships. Figures released last month show that lockdown has made 8% of people realise they need to end their relationship, rising to 15% for those aged between 25 and 34.\n\nPsychotherapist Gin Lalli says this is partly due to the \u201cnewness\u201d of these relationships. \u201cYou tend to find that older couples have been together much longer and weathered more storms. If they have already faced difficulties like redundancies, recessions and bereavements, they\u2019re in a better position to deal with another crisis.\u201d\n\nRelate\u2019s survey supports this, showing that more than a third (38%) of 16- to 34-year-olds in relationships struggled to support their partner emotionally during lockdown, compared with 14% of over-55s.\n\nLalli also points out that younger people\u2019s lives have been more disrupted by coronavirus. \u201cPeople in their 20s and 30s spend a lot of time exploring their own interests and having experiences. They tend to go out more and spend more time travelling, so it was more of a shock to the system.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had one client in her early 30s who had been married for a few years and thought she was very happy,\u201d Lalli says. \u201cThey\u2019d got married because it felt like the right time and seemed like the obvious next step. She and her partner had busy lives outside of the home and each other and would come together for certain events and activities.\u201d\n\nBut when they were forced to be together constantly she realised the conventional life she thought she wanted wasn\u2019t for her. \u201cIt was like a glimpse into retirement and she hated what she saw. With no news to bring in from the outside world, they ran out of things to say to each other. While she was a social butterfly, her partner was more comfortable staying in. It made her realise that they weren\u2019t as compatible as she had thought and she made the difficult decision to leave the relationship before they had a family together.\u201d\n\nIn many cases, the crisis has aggravated existing tensions. Angela, who is in her 50s, had been struggling to cope with her partner\u2019s difficult family long before lockdown. \u201cWe both have adult children from earlier relationships. Although I get on with most of Steve\u2019s family, his daughter has substance abuse problems and I don\u2019t agree with the way they handle it,\u201d she explains. \u201cShe\u2019s stolen money from us on various occasions and my partner doesn\u2019t seem willing to do anything about it. His extended family are always in and out of our home, so it feels like we don\u2019t have our own space.\u201d\n\nDuring lockdown, Steve\u2019s family weren\u2019t able to visit and her relationship with him improved. But the break made her realise that their attitudes to family life were very different. \u201cI love my family but also value my independence and time to myself. He loves having his family around all the time and finds it funny when they make a mess and run wild. There\u2019s just no rules for the grandchildren. He\u2019s also not willing to address his daughter\u2019s issues, which is a big problem for us.\u201d\n\nAs lockdown started to ease, Angela found herself dreading a return to chaos and has made the decision to find a new place to live. \u201cOur values are just not compatible and we can\u2019t go on living like that.\u201d\n\nSteve has accepted her decision to move out and she hopes that they might be able to rebuild the relationship if they live apart. \u201cWe were so much happier when it was just the two of us. It will depend whether he is going to put the effort in when we live separately.\u201d\n\nPeter Saddington, a counsellor and psychosexual therapist for Relate, says that lockdown has accentuated differences in attitudes to parenting and family life. \u201cFor people who have children living at home, being together all the time means that couples get to see the other person\u2019s parenting style constantly,\u201d he says. \u201cI had one couple who were coming to counselling because they had different approaches to parenting. They were making great progress earlier in the year, but lockdown was too much for them. They\u2019ve not been able to agree on anything, which has led to them splitting up.\u201d\n\nSlicing the splice ... many relationships have ended during lockdown. Photograph: Rubberball/Mike Kemp/Getty Images\n\nFor Julie, who is in her 20s, lockdown highlighted how little effort her partner put into family life. \u201cI became pregnant by accident and ever since our daughter was born three years ago, he has made it clear that childcare should be my responsibility,\u201d she says. \u201cHe used work as an excuse and never helped out. Before lockdown, I knew something was wrong but I kept telling myself that everyone goes through tough times and that it is normal for men to behave badly sometimes.\u201d\n\nI am still processing it all, but in the long run I\u2019ve made the right decision for both me and my daughter Julie\n\nWith her partner no longer having the stress of a long daily commute, she expected things to improve, but he still showed no interest in spending time with Julie or their child. \u201cI was shielding, too, as I am in a high-risk group for the virus, which didn\u2019t help. He felt as though he had to be responsible for more because I couldn\u2019t go out to do the shopping, and this made him annoyed.\u201d\n\nEventually, Julie had to be furloughed, as she was unable to cope with her daughter\u2019s needs without any support from her partner. Realising that he was emotionally abusive, she called her parents to come and pick her up. \u201cI am still processing it all, but in the long run I\u2019ve made the right decision for both me and my daughter.\u201d\n\nBefore the pandemic, it was easy to attribute problems in a relationships to the hectic pace of life. Taking away some of those external strains, such as long commutes or travel commitments for work, has meant many people are seeing their relationships clearly for the first time.\n\n\u201cI spoke to one couple with no children who had been having sexual problems for some time,\u201d says Saddington. \u201cThey put it down to having no time due to their busy jobs.\u201d But when lockdown came in, they realised that work had never been the problem. \u201cThey just weren\u2019t attracted to each other any more and they had been too busy to notice they didn\u2019t really like each other.\u201d\n\nLockdown has also made it harder to hide infidelity, Saddington says. \u201cWhen someone doesn\u2019t have the cover of work or nights out with friends, it makes those secret calls and text messages much more obvious. I\u2019ve been counselling one woman who discovered her husband was having an affair during lockdown. His girlfriend had no idea he was married and grew suspicious when he made excuses about why he couldn\u2019t lock down with her. In the end, she contacted his wife to let her know what had been going on.\u201d\n\nWhile many relationships have broken down, Saddington and Lalli say they have also seen couples grow closer. \u201cMost relationships haven\u2019t stayed the same,\u201d says Lalli. \u201cBut the couples who have survived this test have adapted. They tend to have good communication and an understanding of each other, and their vision of their future together is more aligned.\u201d\n\nShe adds that spending 24/7 with one person is not that healthy, no matter how strong your relationship is. \u201cMost of the couples that have coped well in lockdown either set ground rules early on or already had unofficial rules, such as giving the other person space when they need it. The more secure someone is in a relationship, the easier this will have been.\u201d"}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/05/beirut-explosion-lebanon-tell-us-how-you-are-affected", "published": "2020-08-05T09:09:40", "title": "Tell us: how have you been affected by the explosion in Beirut?", "text": "If you have been affected by the events in Beirut you can share your experiences directly with our journalists\n\nTell us: how have you been affected by the explosion in Beirut?\n\nHospitals in the Lebanese capital of Beirut are buckling under the weight of casualties following an explosion in the city on Tuesday which killed at least 100 people and injured 4,000.\n\nMore than 100 people remain missing, and many are feared to have been trapped under the rubble.

For decades after the war, the B-29 Superfortress bomber was left to rot. It was disassembled, its pieces were scattered, birds nested in its engines, and someone smashed its gun turret.\n\nThe man who survived Hiroshima: 'I had entered a living hell on earth' Read more\n\nBehind the neglect lay a deep national ambivalence about what it represented, a quandary which endures today: was this the aircraft that finally ended the second world war, saving hundreds of thousands of lives \u2013 or the instrument of the mass killing of civilians, which heralded a new age of nuclear terror?\n\nWhen the Enola Gay was part restored and plans were made to put in on display at the National Air and Space Museum in 1995, historians agonised over how the exhibit might look at its legacy from all sides. It did not go well.\n\nIn the face of an outcry from air force veterans, who said the exhibition would put Japanese and US responsibility on the same moral plane, the curators scaled back or eliminated the elements focused on the 140,000 people killed in Hiroshima, and the ensuing nuclear arms race. For the critics, even that was not enough. The museum\u2019s director, Martin Harwit, was forced to resign.\n\nWhen the plane was fully restored and moved to the museum\u2019s spectacular new building near Dulles in 2003, there were protests from Japanese survivors and others. Red paint was hurled, denting the airframe.\n\nIn the wake of those battles, the inscription below the Enola Gay today is minimal and bland.\n\n\u201cAlthough designed to fight in the European theater, the B-29 found its niche on the other side of the globe. In the Pacific, B-29s delivered a variety of aerial weapons: conventional bombs, incendiary bombs, mines, and two nuclear weapons,\u201d it reads.\n\nAll reference to the moral, political and historical debate over the bombing of Hiroshima on 6 August 1945 \u2013 and then Nagasaki three days later \u2013 has been left off the public display, but that has not stopped the row from surfacing in the days leading up to the 75th anniversary on Thursday.\n\nThe disagreements are not limited to historians. While the air force view \u2013 which reflects US orthodoxy \u2013 is that the use of atomic weapons stopped the war and prevented much worse bloodshed, the National Museum of the US Navy has a different take.\n\n\u201cThe vast destruction wreaked by the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the loss of 135,000 people made little impact on the Japanese military,\u201d it says on a plaque beside a replica of Little Boy, the bomb Enola Gay dropped on Hiroshima.\n\n\u201cHowever, the Soviet invasion of Manchuria on 9 August \u2013 fulfilling a promise of the Yalta conference in February \u2013 changed their minds.\u201d\n\nThe plaque reflects the views of US navy leadership at the time.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Peace activists arrange ribbons near the Hiroshima memorial museum.

Photograph: Carl Court/Getty Images\n\n\u201c[T]he use of this barbarous weapon at Hiroshima and Nagasaki was of no material assistance in our war against Japan. The Japanese were already defeated and ready to surrender,\u201d wrote Adm William Leahy, who presided over the combined US-UK chiefs of staff.\n\nThe general who had won the war in Europe months earlier, Dwight Eisenhower, recalled his reaction to being told by the secretary of war, Henry Stimson, that the atomic bomb would be used.\n\n\u201cI voiced to him my grave misgivings, first on the basis of my belief that Japan was already defeated and that dropping the bomb was completely unnecessary, and secondly because I thought that our country should avoid shocking world opinion by the use of a weapon,\u201d Eisenhower told his biographer, Stephen Ambrose.\n\nOne of the most contentious issues remains the role of the US secretary of state, James Byrnes, in influencing the decisions of the new president, Harry Truman, who was inexperienced in foreign policy.\n\nAt the Potsdam conference in mid-July 1945, which brought together Truman, Joseph Stalin and Winston Churchill (replaced during the summit by Clement Attlee), an ultimatum was issued to Japan to surrender. Byrnes was instrumental in removing a paragraph offering to allow Emperor Hirohito to retain his title, the primary Japanese condition.\n\nI'd say Soviet entry into the war had a more decisive impact on the decision to surrender Tsuyoshi Hasegawa\n\n\u201cThe proclamation was issued without any assurances, knowing that it could not be accepted, and then the bombs went forward,\u201d said the historian Gar Alperovitz, a professor of political economy at the University of Maryland and the author of two books on the diplomacy surrounding the decision to use atomic weapons.\n\nMichael Kort, a social sciences professor at Boston University, who wrote The Columbia Guide to Hiroshima and the Bomb, argues the inclusion of the offer in the Potsdam declaration would not have shortened the war on its own.\n\n\u201cThe Japanese military had a whole bunch of other other conditions as well,\u201d Kort said. \u201cAlso, what we meant was the Emperor stays on the throne as a constitutional monarch. What the Japanese meant was their demand that the Emperor remain with all his powers.\u201d\n\nWhen the Enola Gay dropped the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima on 6 August, the Japanese ambassador in Moscow was sounding out the Soviets on terms for a negotiated end to the war.\n\nThe destruction of Hiroshima did not change the Japanese negotiating position. That came with a double blow starting two days later. On the evening of 8 August, the Soviets announced they would be entering the war against Japan, as Stalin had promised Franklin Roosevelt and Churchill at Yalta. Hours after that, the second atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki.\n\nHistorians are divided over whether the bombs or the Soviet declaration alone might have ended the war.\n\n\u201cDespite the Hiroshima bomb, the Japanese government still continued seek the termination of the war through Moscow\u2019s mediation,\u201d said Tsuyoshi Hasegawa, former research professor at the University of California in Santa Barbara, and an expert on Soviet-Japanese diplomacy at the time.\n\n\u201cI would say that the Soviet entry into the war had a more decisive impact on the decision to surrender than the atomic bombs.\u201d\n\nThat view is disputed by the Rev Wilson Miscamble, a history professor at the University of Notre Dame.\n\n\u201cEven after the Soviet entry into the war, certain elements of the Japanese military wanted to continue fighting. But it was Hirohito\u2019s motivation, brought on by his recognition of the damage of the bombs, that brought him to engage directly with his government, and to order the surrender,\u201d Miscamble said.\n\n'He felt he had to do it': Truman's grandson on bombing Hiroshima Read more\n\n\u201cSo, if the bomb was most decisive on Hirohito, and if Hirohito was the most decisive figure in ordering surrender, I think we can conclude that the bombs were the decisive element in bringing about Japan\u2019s surrender.\u201d\n\nThe US invasion of the Japanese home islands was not due until November, so some have argued Truman could have put off the decision to use atomic weapons for some time to see what effect the Russian intervention would have. Alperovitz argues that the timing of the bombs was aimed at stopping the war before the Red Army moved too deep into Manchuria.\n\n\u201cIt is not an accident the bombs were dropped on 6 August and 9 August, just around the time we had expected the Russians to enter the war,\u201d he said.\n\nMiscamble argues that takes too narrow a view of the scope of the war and the number of lives at stake.\n\n\u201cThe object was to end the war as quickly as possible, because lives were being lost all over Asia,\u201d he said. \u201cWould it really have been moral to stand aside so as to maintain one\u2019s supposed moral purity, while a vast slaughter occurred at the rate of over 200,000 deaths a month? Is there not a tragic dilemma here \u2013 which innocent lives to save?\u201d"}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/05/our-identity-has-been-robbed-life-in-kashmir-after-a-year-of-crisis", "published": "2020-08-05T00:00:15", "title": "'Our identity has been robbed': life in Kashmir after a year of crisis", "text": "'Our identity has been robbed': life in Kashmir after a year of crisis\n\nFor the past year, Fayaz Tilgami\u2019s poetry has spoken of nothing but loss: a lost home, a lost language, a lost world. \u201cWe have lost our existence; it has been snatched from us,\u201d said the 70-year-old Kashmiri poet, his voice heavy with sorrow.\n\nA year ago, on 5 August 2019, the Indian government, led by prime minister Narendra Modi, repealed article 370 of the Indian constitution. For almost 70 years, the provision had given the disputed, majority-Muslim state of Jammu and Kashmir a semi-autonomous status, with special powers over issues such as jobs and residency. The special status had been granted to Kashmir in exchange for joining the Indian union after independence in 1947.\n\nIn one fell swoop, everything changed. With a swift presidential order, the Himalayan region was brought under the full control of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) government and split into two union territories, no different from any other Indian state.

The state was formally taken under direct federal control and split into the territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh, bringing an end to decades of semi-autonomous rule. The decision to tighten the government\u2019s grip over the region stoked anger and resentment. Modi's party says it will conduct nation-wide citizenship checks Modi's right-hand man, home minister Amit Shah, tells parliament he will seek to have every Indian prove their citizenship in order to root out illegal migrants. The citizenship checks are modelled on a process that took place this year in Assam state which has left 2m people in legal limbo and was criticised by the UN as \"an enormous blow to global efforts to eradicate statelessness\".\n\nCitizenship bill A new citizenship bill provides a path to citizenship for religious minorities who have immigrated into India from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan before 31 December 2014. It explicitly lists Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians as being able to take advantage of the new provisions, excluding Muslims. Street protests begin as a result.\n\nThe repeal of article 370 was justified by the Modi government on the grounds of bringing economic prosperity to the turbulent region, opening it up to outside investment, and eliminating Pakistan-supported militants. \u201cRepealing article 370 shut the gateway to terrorism,\u201d claimed the home affairs minister, Amit Shah.\n\nYet residents of Kashmir have instead found themselves living in a region far more volatile, unstable and economically fragile than ever. The impact of the crackdown, in particular a six-month internet shutdown, led to huge economic losses and unemployment and cost the Kashmiri economy an estimated $5.3bn (\u00a34bn) \u2013 a situation only worsened by the coronavirus lockdown that followed.\n\nThe Indian government did little to encourage economic prosperity other than to change strict domicile rules, which had previously prevented non-Kashmiris from buying land, property and investing in the region. Non-Kashmiris have been granted residency in the state since last August.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A Kashmiri woman asks a police officer if she can cross the street in Srinagar. Photograph: Mukhtar Khan/AP\n\nFor Kashmiris, the residency status for non-Kashmiris was proof that Modi\u2019s real aim was to advance the Hindu nationalist agenda of his BJP government, which wants to establish India as a Hindu rather than secular country, by shifting the demographics of the region away from being majority Muslim.\n\nSibtain, a 33-year-old from Srinagar, said he felt \u201cmaddened\u201d at the very real prospect of becoming \u201ca second-class citizen\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe worst fear I have is that Kashmir will lose its identity, we will just be subsumed into a much bigger Hindu India,\u201d he said.\n\nThe security situation remains equally precarious, seeping into the lives of all those living in the region, with civilians dying and houses destroyed.\n\nRather than bringing calm to the region, a heavy security presence and and counter-insurgency campaign has instead led to weekly violent encounters between Indian troops and a new generation of militants. According to human rights organisations, between 1 January and 20 June, there were 229 killings, of which 32 were civilians, 54 were government forces and 143 were militants, while 48 properties were destroyed.\n\n\u201cThere is not a single house in the district which has not been searched and not a single village where the [counter-insurgency] operation may not have been launched,\u201d said a resident of Shopian district in south Kashmir.\n\nDespite being outnumbered, inexperienced and poorly armed, radicalised young militants have revived a dying insurgency..\n\nShakoor Farooqi was in his late teens when he disappeared without a trace last year.

Photograph: Mukhtar Khan/AP\n\nFarooqi was killed in a gunfight in June, having refused the offer to surrender when he was cornered by Indian forces in a house in Srinagar, alongside two other militants. Ahmad was called by authorities to the scene to try and convince his son to surrender, but his desperately shouted pleas went unanswered. \u201cThere were curtains drawn on the windows and there was not a single whisper from there,\u201d said Ahmad. \u201cIt was like a war on the border, there were so many policemen.\u201d\n\nAhmad believes his son was \u201cmartyred\u201d. \u201cA father goes through so much pain to raise his children. It is so unfortunate what happens here,\u201d he said.\n\nRepealing article 370 has also had security reverberations on a geopolitical level. Many believe that China\u2019s recent incursions into disputed territory in Ladakh, the Himalayan border region adjacent to Kashmir, were partly prompted as a retaliatory move in response to India taking full control of Kashmir. India-Pakistan relations, meanwhile, have rarely been so fraught.\n\nSitting in his home in north Kashmir\u2019s Tilgam, the village known for producing generations of poets, Tilgami said he would keep writing poetry that documented the despair still so potent in Kashmir, even though he has been repeatedly threatened with arrest by security agencies.\n\n\u201cThe poetry is no longer about love,\u201d said Tilgami. \u201cIt is about what one feels around; the helplessness, the chaos. There are dead everywhere.\u201d"}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/aug/04/one-thing-ive-learned-about-modern-farming-we-shouldnt-do-it-like-this", "published": "2020-08-04T11:01:03", "title": "'One thing I've learned about modern farming \u2013 we shouldn't do it like this'", "text": "As we walked quietly through the trees, the water ahead looked like a manmade fishing lake, or maybe a small reservoir. We were in a strip of forest, along a single-track road, making our way towards a huge industrial farm. It was overcast and the high trees made the day even more gloomy.\n\nWe had been hired to investigate conditions on farms supplying UK supermarkets for a TV programme and not-for-profit campaign, and that was how we found ourselves at this giant pig farm in Poland. The arrival of foreign meat companies in the country was proving controversial. Local people were worried about the environmental consequences \u2013 as well as impacts on smaller-scale farmers \u2013 of having a multinational meat firm pitch up on their doorstep.\n\nWe had arrived the day before, sleeping very little before driving for hours into the countryside. I was twitchy, a little nervous, head aching from a night on a lumpy, unfamiliar mattress. We knew the farm was around here somewhere, but weren\u2019t sure which direction to take. And then ahead of us, through the trees, we spotted the lake. At the same time the smell reached us: an appalling stench, one of the worst smells I have ever encountered in my life.\n\nThis was no lake. It was an open cesspit, a vast lagoon full of waste from the pig farm. Floating beneath the surface were the bodies of pigs in various stages of decomposition. Through the filth we could see snouts and curly tails.\n\nEverywhere was the detritus of factory farming \u2013 plastic syringe casings, needles and white clinical gloves \u2013 floating in the rancid pool and discarded on adjacent farmland. It was the first time I\u2019d ever stepped on to a factory farm. It was a moment I would never be able to forget.\n\nI grew up mainly in towns and cities. My experience of farming was limited to those compulsory-but-dull school or Scouts visits to the local dairy, or the livestock you might come across during family days out in the countryside.\n\nIn the early 1990s, I remember seeing television reports about the BSE scandal and hearing talk about the perils of eating beef. But I was a teenager. I had more important things to worry about. But in 2001, the foot and mouth disaster unfolded across the UK, with its burning cattle pyres and \u201cno entry\u201d signs erected across the countryside. This time I paid attention. The whole episode \u2013 devastated farmers, a rural economy in tatters, millions of farm animals culled, political wrangling and endless debates about who or what was to blame \u2013 highlighted somehow that something had gone wrong with the way we were farming and producing food.\n\nAfterwards, the smell stayed with us \u2013 on our clothes, our skin, our hair \u2013 seemingly for days\n\nI went into journalism, working freelance for magazines and newspapers. In late 2003 I co-founded a media outfit \u2013 part production company, part detective agency \u2013 to carry out investigations into environmental and human rights issues, as well as animal welfare. We wanted to use the tactics of the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA), who\u2019d pioneered using dummy companies, hidden cameras and undercover agents to expose the ivory trade and illegal logging, to work as journalists and also for not-for-profit groups. Business was brisk. Demand for our work was high, and in 2005 we were commissioned to go to Poland.\n\nAlthough we were increasingly aware of the way our food was being produced thanks to the work of journalists such as Felicity Lawrence and Joanna Blythman, for me, as for most people, modern farming remained remote abstraction.\n\nNewborn calf separated from mother at dairy farm, Spain, 2010.\n\nBut now, here in Poland, I was seeing the reality. In one vast, windowless warehouse, hundreds of young pigs were visible under the artificial lights: moving, squealing, eating, shitting. The unmistakable waft of animal waste and chemicals. Lame and injured pigs \u2013 one had an abnormal growth the size of a grapefruit, some looked emaciated, others appeared sick \u2013 and dead animals left abandoned on the ground, live pigs rustling around the carcasses. On the wall, charts recording the animals that had died \u2013 so-called mortality records \u2013 and medication sheets detailing the antibiotics that could be used.\n\nAfterwards, the smell stayed with us \u2013 on our clothes, our skin, our hair \u2013 seemingly for days.\n\nWhy was our food being produced like this? It was shocking and I wanted to know more.\n\nI have now spent the best part of a decade and a half reporting on almost every aspect of the global meat industry. It is a journey that has taken me to farms of all types and sizes, from family smallholdings to vast concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs), and into abattoirs, livestock markets, ports and food factories in numerous countries.\n\nThere is a widespread culture of secrecy and a lack of accountability in the global meat industry, which is dominated by a handful of powerful yet little known corporations. Shining a light on \u201cbig ag\u2019s\u201d murkier corners therefore requires months of research, the sourcing of often suppressed data and documents, working with whistleblowers, and undercover investigations.\n\nIn reality, quite often it\u2019s about seizing the moment. Quickly pointing the camera through an open window or barn door or locked gate, or under a wire fence. You film what you find, first a scene-setting shot, to give a sense of scale and context, then close-ups to bring details to life.\n\nSometimes, if you are following up a tipoff about a particularly problematic farm, what you see might be distressing \u2013 a pile of dead and dying chickens; a spent dairy cow, sprawled out on the floor taking its last gasps; an injured sheep, still alive, maggots in its wounds \u2013 accompanied by a backdrop of ear-deafening squeals or incessant grunts from confined livestock or the nauseating smell of waste as you try to focus.\n\nIt always feels like you\u2019ve stayed too long, even if it has only been seconds. You worry you haven\u2019t got enough pictures \u2013 farms are inevitably dark and not conducive to cinematic beauty \u2013 and you pray the camera has done its job.\n\nOften, there\u2019s simply too much happening to know where to point the camera, such as when a shedload of chickens are being rounded up for slaughter, workers swarming around you in near-darkness.\n\nSome of the farmers I\u2019ve visited over the years are happy to have us; they\u2019ve nothing to hide and welcome the opportunity to talk about the challenges of making ends meet. Sometimes \u2013 particularly in the case of large corporate-owned farms or slaughterhouses \u2013 open filming isn\u2019t an option. You have to rely on undercover reporting and hidden cameras.\n\nCaged hens, Spain, 2010\n\nIn the old days you could do it and worry about the details later, as long as you used common sense, adhered to biosecurity and basic health and safety rules. Now, any covert reporting has to be cleared in advance by editors and lawyers and requires lots of form filling, to make sure there\u2019s public interest and justification. That\u2019s as it should be, but it certainly makes things more complicated.\n\nAt one farm, the corpse of a horse lay sprawled outside, blood visible on the ground\n\nAs a journalist, it\u2019s my job to go and see for myself the worst conditions that I hear about. In Italy, on farms supplying \u201cartisanal\u201d parma ham, I saw pigs held in battery conditions, with animals confined in metal cages \u2013 gestation crates, or sow stalls \u2013 designed for those that have been recently inseminated. They had no room to turn around: the cages weren\u2019t much wider than the pigs themselves.\n\nIn Portugal, I saw pigs being repeatedly hit and dragged by the ears, squealing, on to transporters before starting their journey to slaughter. In Spain, thousands of quails \u2013 reared for their eggs \u2013 were crammed into filthy battery cages, many having lost feathers and others dead and left to rot. Calves, too \u2013 some subject to journeys on trucks that take days \u2013 confined in solitary pens as part of the veal trade.\n\nIn Bulgaria, I visited primitive horse and donkey farms, including one where animals were fixed to the wall or floor with rope and chains. Some had little, if any, straw or other bedding. At one farm, the corpse of a horse lay sprawled outside, blood visible on the ground. Similarly, in Croatia, I saw cattle tethered day and night in darkened sheds, some never having set foot on grass.\n\nIn Chile, I saw vast offshore \u201cfloating feedlots\u201d with thousands of salmon packed into underwater cages. In the UK \u2013 at one of the country\u2019s biggest intensive beef farms \u2013 we saw cows caked in excrement and other waste in flooded, dirty yards with no protection from the elements.\n\nCoronavirus: world treating symptoms, not cause of pandemics, says UN Read more\n\nAnd in poultry units across Europe, time and again I\u2019ve seen broiler chickens, turkeys, ducks and geese crammed into vast, crowded sheds with no outside access. Each morning on these farms, workers remove the birds that have died overnight. Sometimes a handful, sometimes scores of birds, flung into piles on the floor or loaded on to wheelbarrows, and chicks disposed of \u2013 some still alive \u2013 into skips piled high with carcasses.\n\nThese scenes illustrate the virtual worthlessness of individual birds. On some farms, hundreds of birds can die each week \u2013 in the UK, more than a million chickens die before reaching the slaughterhouse each year.\n\nA duck farm in Australia, 2017\n\nThe chain doesn\u2019t end on farms. Animals have to be processed into meat, and slaughterhouses have faced repeated allegations of cruelty, despite supposedly stringent oversight in many countries.\n\nThe slaughterman offered me the knife in case I wanted a go. I declined\n\nI\u2019ve been inside poultry and rabbit abattoirs. I worked undercover in Portugal, capturing footage at a slaughterhouse specialising in suckling pigs, usually roasted whole as a popular treat. The graphic scenes we filmed caused uproar in a country where few people had seen how their meat was being produced.\n\nAfter being unloaded, the pigs were taken to a stun room containing a series of small holding pens where a worker, using what looked like a large pair of tongs, stood among the squealing animals and calmly applied a shock to each one\u2019s head before shackling the bodies on to the moving production line which carried them up through a hatch in the wall.\n\nSome twitched involuntarily after being attached to the moving rail, others appeared to be fully conscious as they moved along the line, eyes open and kicking, into the kill room. Here, a worker plunged a large knife into each pig\u2019s neck, causing a gush of blood to shoot down into a tray below, and holding each pig by the legs as they began to \u201cbleed out\u201d.\n\nThe slaughterman offered me the knife in case I wanted a go. I declined.\n\nWhere cameras can\u2019t go, you have to rely on other evidence. Unpublished reports by UK vets and hygiene inspectors that I obtained detailed thousands of \u2013 apparently industrywide \u2013 breaches of welfare regulations, including instances of chickens and pigs being boiled alive after being immersed into tanks of scalding hot water, used to soften the skin and remove hair or feathers.\n\nBroiler chickens, Spain, 2009\n\nThe smell and sounds and frenetic activity of an abattoir don\u2019t leave you. The whirring of machinery, the clinking of chains, the animal cries, the shouts of workers, the steam, the blood and offal; carcasses swinging on the line. The animals may be stressed, but you wonder also what impact this has on the workers who do this, day in, day out.\n\nThe effects of these industrial systems are not just felt in the farmyards or the slaughterhouses. I have seen the wider impact of the quest for food miles away from the farms. Animals that once lived off the land, or off waste, are now given bags of expensive industrially produced feed; the need to fatten them as quickly as possible demands huge inputs of protein, and that protein is pulled from all over the world.\n\nThe sea lions had been slaughtered by local fishermen, who saw them as competitors for dwindling fish resources\n\nSoy is one source. I\u2019ve reported on the well-known problems with deforestation but I\u2019ve alsowritten about some of the chilling human rights abuses connected to the industry in Paraguay, where much soy was destined for factory farms in China and Europe. Peasant and indigenous organisations had been protesting against the encroachment of the soy farms on their land. The response from some of the soy farmers \u2013 with the backing of police and paramilitary units \u2013 was brutal: violent evictions, shootings and beatings, resulting in numerous injuries and several deaths, as well as arbitrary detentions and disappearances.\n\nFishmeal is another source of protein with its own impact, as I saw in Peru. Yards away from the bustling port of Chimbote, lying on the rubbish-strewn beach, were the carcasses of about six sea lions, quietly rotting in the sunshine. Their normally grey silky skin had turned a rusty, orange hue. One carcass, its eyes long since gone and tongue spilling out from its swollen body, was swarming with flies.\n\nThe sea lions had been slaughtered by local fishermen, who saw them as competitors for dwindling fish resources in this part of the Pacific. Demand for anchovy \u2013 hoovered up for use in fishmeal and fish oil \u2013 had impacted on the sea\u2019s natural food chain, and reduced stocks of previously plentiful species fished for human consumption.\n\nForty fishmeal factories were processing anchovies caught by the city\u2019s fleet, and the area had become a major flashpoint for conflict. (New fishmeal frontiers in west Africa and Asia have joined the party, bringing fresh problems.)\n\nI visited one poor community where more than a dozen women and children gathered in the dusty, unpaved street to vent their anger at pollution from the fishmeal plants: they claimed they were responsible for asthma, bronchial and skin problems, particularly in children.\n\nDairy cows wait in line to be milked, Spain, 2010\n\nFootage filmed by residents showed conditions when plants were operational: billowing black smoke drifted through the streets, obscuring vision and choking passersby. It looked like the aftermath of a bomb.\n\nAccording to environmentalists, the sea in Ferrol Bay off Chimbote was now becoming a \u201cdead zone\u201d, largely due to contamination from the fishmeal industry. The plants were accused of discharging protein, fat and oil into the bay, as well as contaminated marine water used during the process of pumping fish from the ship\u2019s hull to the processing plant.\n\nI remember looking at the ocean stretching out in front of us, and feeling anger and bewilderment that it was being choked of life \u2013 quite literally \u2013 largely to feed livestock confined in far-off farms.\n\nSo how did we end up with this system? Industry chiefs I\u2019ve interviewed argue that factory farms exist because of the demand for cheap meat, and that producing enough of it efficiently to meet that demand is possible only by using intensive systems.\n\nBanks and pension funds among investors bankrolling meat and dairy Read more\n\nThey point out that supermarkets \u2013 arguably the biggest champions of cheap food \u2013 require reliable and consistent supplies that meet exact specifications, all year round. Sourcing on such a scale simply wouldn\u2019t be viable if they bought only from the smaller, independent family-owned farms run in the traditional ways.\n\nAnd despite the furore around the spread of megafarms, size isn\u2019t an indicator of the welfare standards they maintain; in fact larger, more modern units are often superior, with hi-tech systems and good veterinary care.\n\nDespite what I\u2019ve seen, experience tells me that the majority of livestock farmers are decent, hardworking folk who do their best to make a living in an industry where money doesn\u2019t readily flow down to the small guys, and where margins are often so slim that any unforeseen event can prove catastrophic.\n\nA North Carolina pig farm with open-air pig waste lagoon\n\nI have spoken to dairy farmers who are trying desperately to keep their businesses afloat but acknowledge that, at some point, their farms will have to close, despite in some cases being in the same family for generations. I\u2019ve spoken to beef farmers \u2013 some of whom quietly expressed criticism of the intensive feedlot-style cattle farms popping up across the UK \u2013 that have dedicated themselves to offering higher welfare, grass-fed beef sold directly to the public as an alternative to cheap supermarket products.\n\nMany of these farmers are as much victims of the system as their livestock.\n\nIn the age of hyper-cheap food you can pick up a whole chicken for a few pounds, and a pint of milk for less than a bottle of water. Yet these prices fail to reflect the true cost of production. The terms dictated by supermarkets and processing companies put too many farmers in the grotesque position of losing money on the foodstuffs they\u2019ve spent weeks, months or years producing.\n\nAbout 70 billion land animals are produced globally for food each year, an estimated two-thirds in intensive conditions\n\nIt\u2019s the sheer scale of production, driven by insatiable demand, that is the problem, fuelling bigger farms and more intensive systems \u2013 the more animals you can squeeze in, the more food you can produce, the more money there is to be made.\n\nMegafarms that house thousands of pigs, poultry, beef and dairy cattle are now common. But when things go wrong \u2013 fires, floods, disease outbreaks, equipment breakdowns, pollution \u2013 the bigger the farm, the bigger the consequences.\n\nCoupled with vertically integrated supply chains and controversial contract farming models \u2013 which, critics say, outsource many of the financial risks to farmers \u2013 this has unavoidably created a system which has turned farm animals into mere commodities. \u201cMeat machines\u201d, as one campaigner put it.\n\nThe language used in the poultry industry illustrates the point: industrially produced chickens are no longer referred to as birds but as \u201ccrops\u201d, in the same way as you might refer to a field of lettuces or tomatoes. Chicken producers can be referred to as \u201cgrowers\u201d, not farmers, and it comes as no surprise that they are not paid for individual birds, but for the weight each \u201ccrop\u201d of chickens achieves.\n\nAs one UK farmer told me, modern chicken sheds are simply \u201cpetri dishes of live protein-on-legs\u201d.\n\nA Spanish rabbit abattoir, 2013\n\nAbout 70 billion land animals are produced globally for food each year, an estimated two-thirds reared in intensive conditions. Many of the issues this raises, and which I\u2019ve covered extensively \u2013 food safety, antibiotic resistance, animal welfare, exploitation of workers, pollution, deforestation \u2013 are now firmly on the global agenda and commanding attention.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has prompted renewed calls for change: in the US, some politicians are calling for the biggest factory farms to be phased out by 2040. Even the UN is urging a rethink of industrial farming, citing links with zoonotic infections and the widespread use of arable land for animal feed, driving deforestation.\n\nAddressing the question of how the world produces enough meat, safely and sustainably (and humanely), to feed a growing population while safeguarding the environment, is more relevant \u2013 and more complicated \u2013 than ever.\n\nI\u2019ll leave it to scientists and others more qualified than me to answer this question. But, thinking back to that squalid farm in Poland, and everything I\u2019ve seen since, I can safely say one thing: we shouldn\u2019t do it like this.\n\nThis is an edited extract from a longer version of this article, which can be found on Medium.com"}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/aug/05/how-renamed-streets-in-mumbais-slums-are-encouraging-children-to-study", "published": "2020-08-05T06:45:23", "title": "How renamed streets in Mumbai's slums are encouraging children to study", "text": "No map of Mumbai mentions Rehmuddin Shaikh Road.

Today, he is a rugby star, winning national gold and silver medals and and now coaching the Indian women\u2019s team. He is one of the only four coaches in India to qualify for the World Rugby Level 3 coaching course.\n\nAs a child, he was a student of Door Step School, a classroom on wheels for children who had no other access to education. Now the school\u2019s co-founder is leading the project to name these narrow, winding alleys of the slum after her best and hardest-working pupils.\n\n\u201cI felt honoured when my name was assigned to the very alley I lived in,\u201d said Shaikh. \u201cNormally, roads are named after famous people who are dead. This was the first time it was being named after a person who is alive.\u201d\n\nA stranger would find it extremely difficult to locate any house in Mumbai\u2019s slums without finding someone who lives close by to give directions. The slums are a labyrinth even for residents who face the frustrations and the challenges of living without an address, and children are particularly affected by the issue.\n\nBina Sheth Lashkari, the social worker and co-founder of Door Step, came up with the idea to name the streets after the most promising students to encourage local children to study. To date, a dozen streets bear the silver and black signposts.\n\n\u201cWhen I see Devi Chauhan Road, named after a girl from my Banjara community, I feel proud, encouraged and inspired to complete my education to become confident and independent,\u201d said Roshani Chuvan, 11, a student.\n\nShaikh\u2019s mother, Saulibi Shaikh, said: \u201cWe came to Mumbai from Gulbarga, Karnataka, India, in search of work as life was tough. My son fought adversity to reach this level. I used to leave the kids when I went to work, but the teachers motivated him. I am proud about his achievements.\u201d\n\nIt was Lashkari who talked the family into sending Shaikh to school. \u201cWe had a very tough time convincing his parents. He too was reluctant to start school but once admitted he was very sincere,\u201d said Lashkari, who believes the street names are a huge motivation for children, their family and community,\n\nKanchan Chandrasen More was once a pupil and is now a teacher at the Door Step School. \u201cI felt very happy and humbled when my name was assigned to an alley,\u201d she said.\n\nJayashree Chandrasen More, her mother, says she is delighted that her daughter is engaged in educating kids. \u201cMy daughter has made us proud and brought fame to our family.\u201d\n\nBack in 1988, Lashkari saw how the children of construction workers, mainly migrants from Gulbarga, were not going to school but instead working as labourers.\n\nLashkari began offering to teach after the working hours. \u201cIf children can\u2019t go to the school, let the school come to them,\u201d she said.\n\nThis was the vision that led her and her colleague, Rajani Paranjpe to establish the first Door Step School in 1988.\n\nInitially, they found children at the railway stations and other public places and started holding outdoor classes, which became difficult in busy areas. To solve this problem, they moved to a makeshift mobile classroom \u2013 a bus for classes.\n\nSchool on Wheels has been educating slum children ever since and now there are seven schools across Mumbai and Pune with 800 teachers and volunteers reaching 100,000 children. Children sit on the floor using the windows, which open inwards,as desks, stationery is provided free of cost. More than 100 students are taught in each bus in groups of 20-25 for three to four hours.\n\nRekha Shamakant Wareshi, a Mumbai teacher, joined the NGO 17 years ago. The teaching approach is practical and kids are taught through everyday examples. Emphasis is laid on improving language skills.\n\nIn April, when India\u2019s government abruptly announced a nationwide lockdown amid the pandemic, Door Step had to close like other Indian schools. A WhatsApp group was formed for parents with wifi access and those with basic phones were called, all designed to encourage children to keep up their studies at home.\n\nThe founders of Door Step hope they will be back on their buses soon, said Lashkari. \u201cIt was very important to remain connected with the kids who are experiencing a lot of trauma in these uncertain times to ignite hope that someday when things are normal the school will continue.\u201d"}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/04/i-just-dont-exist-the-italian-chef-italy-will-not-recognise", "published": "2020-08-04T09:00:05", "title": "'I just don't exist': the Italian chef Italy will not recognise", "text": "Early rays of sunshine filter through the kitchen shutters as Luca Neves launches one of his daily live cooking sessions on Facebook.

Between 3.9 and 4.8 million people in Europe are believed to be living without residency permits, about 65% of whom are under 35 years old, according to the Pew Research Center. In the UK, a recent University of Wolverhampton study commissioned by the mayor of London estimated there are 332,000 children and young people living undocumented in the UK, including 106,000 children born in the country. Estimating numbers of undocumented people necessarily involves guesswork \u2013 and the methodologies are often criticised \u2013 but it is thought there are millions of dreamers across Europe.\n\n\n\nAs he broadcasts from his kitchen in an anonymous apartment block in Appio Claudio, a densely populated district in eastern Rome, Neves hides a wound. For more than 12 years, he has been undocumented.\n\nHe is one of millions across Europe. An estimated 600,000 people live in the country without documentation, according to the Istituto per gli Studi di Politici Internazionali thinktank. The numbers have risen sharply since a 2018 \u201csecurity decree\u201d by the former interior minister Matteo Salvini, leader of the far-right Lega party, removed humanitarian protection permits.\n\nIf you\u2019re born to foreign parents in Italy, the smallest mistake in your teens can turn you into a ghost\n\nUnlike the vast majority of these people, Neves, 32, never migrated to Italy: he was born in the country. But when you\u2019re born to foreign parents in Italy, the smallest mistake in your late teens can affect your whole life, and turn you into a ghost.\n\nIt was 1975 when Luca\u2019s father, Joaquim Antonio Neves, a sailor, disembarked at the port of Nettuno, 50km south-west of Rome. His mother was already working as a housemaid in the capital. Like countless Cape Verdean young women before her, Maria Araujo \u2013 known as Cristallina \u2013 had left hardship in the small archipelago nation in the Atlantic, responding to requests for domestic workers by a growing Roman bourgeoisie.\n\nJoaquim Antonio had travelled the world but accepted the offer of work with a fisherman in Nettuno. He stayed on in Italy, met Cristallina and the couple settled down in Rome.\n\nTheir son, Luca, grew up in Trigoria, a suburb known for hosting the Roma football club\u2019s training ground. As a teenager, he would deliver pizza to famous players such as Cafu, Francesco Totti and Gabriel Batistuta. When he wasn\u2019t studying at a vocational school for hotel and catering he was doing odd jobs or making music.\n\nIn the 90s, the Neves were one of the few black families in the district. Luca learned to react to racist comments with dignity. \u201cMy mother had given me a life-changing lesson: instead of listening to my complaints she looked me in the eyes and told me it was on me to decide how others will treat me,\u201d he remembers.\n\nLike many of his friends, at 18 he was trying to decide whether he should embark on an uncertain career in music or an apprenticeship to become a chef.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Luca Neves has fought to climb the ladder of Italy\u2019s culinary scene. Photograph: Blaq Italiano/Youtube\n\nHis plans were interrupted in late 2007. According to a 1992 Italian citizenship law, one of the most restrictive in the EU, children born in Italy to foreign parents have one year \u2013 between the ages of 18 and 19 \u2013 to apply for citizenship.\n\nWhile his parents \u201cworked, worked and worked\u201d, Luca faced daunting bureaucracy. By the time he had gathered the necessary paperwork it was too late: he had turned 19.\n\n\u201cThis is where my Calvary began,\u201d he says, shaking his head.\n\nIn 2013, his mother died after a stroke. Months before, he was stopped by police and received a deportation order. \u201cI was so busy helping her that I passed the time limit to appeal against that order,\u201d he says.\n\nRome is my history / gives my identity / gives me my freedom: tell me where you want to chase me to? Fat Negga\n\nRemarkably, even though he lacked any official status in Italy, Neves managed to climb the ladder of Rome\u2019s culinary scene. He proudly recalls the day he was congratulated for his spaghetti alla carbonara, while working illegally in a well-known trattoria. \u201cThey offered me contracts of up to \u20ac4,000 a month as a head chef, but I had to refuse,\u201d he says. No job contract could undo the pending deportation order.\n\nIn the meantime, Neves had also developed a budding hip-hop career. He was touring Italy performing as Fat Negga, his tracks mixing Cape Verdean creole with Roman slang. \u201cRome is my history, gives my identity, gives me my freedom: tell me where you want to chase me to?\u201d he sings on Fat Negga\u2019s last, unpublished track, La mia citt\u00e0 [My city].\n\nIn 2017, he fell in love with H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Mastroianni, a dance teacher, and they decided to tour together, combining music and dance. But they had to decline multiple offers to perform outside Italy. \u201cI often feel like we have two lives: our everyday one, where we make plans, we argue, we laugh, and a parallel one, where everything is ruined by Luca\u2019s invisibility, by a constant fear,\u201d explains H\u00e9l\u00e8ne.\n\nIn late 2019, this second life was about to swallow the first. Luca had applied for the right to remain under family reunification rules. He had a good case because his father had suffered multiple heart attacks.\n\nOn 19 September, he arrived at the central police immigration office to collect his documents, full of hope. But minutes later, he found himself locked in a cell in the building\u2019s basement.\n\nHe had secretly slipped his phone into his documents folder. He texted his lawyer, and H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, who was waiting outside the station. \u201cIt was like being dragged into a pit, with no holds: it took us a while to breathe again,\u201d she remembers.\n\nOne officer told Neves that the only way out was a plane to Cape Verde, a country Neves had only visited on holiday at the age of six. As the local detention facility in Ponte Galeria was at full capacity, Neves was given a one-month order to sign in with authorities twice a week. The next day, that order was revoked by a judge who decided there was no realistic prospect of returning him to Cape Verde, since he was born in Italy. It was nightfall by the time they freed him.\n\nPaula Baudet Vivanco, a spokesperson for Italiani Senza Cittadinanza (Italians Without Citizenship), a grassroots movement advocating for reform of Italian citizenship law, says Luca\u2019s case \u201cis an extreme one, exposing all the flaws of old norms\u201d about what it means to be Italian. Her group advocates for the children of immigrants to be naturalised at birth or during their schooling.\n\nItaliani Senza Cittadinanza estimates at least 900,000 people born in Italy are currently unable to become citizens, either because they are under 18, or failed to meet the strict criteria and time limitations. If they are unable to keep renewing their permit of stay for family or work reasons, they can easily fall into irregularity.\n\nThe idea that we\u2019re all in the same boat is wrong. Italians without citizenship are left drowning Baudent Vivanco\n\n\u201cUsually at 18, a young Italian thinks about their driving licence, votes for the first time \u2026 for us, it\u2019s as if adulthood arrives much later,\u201d Baudet Vivanco says. \u201cYou spend your best years waiting, refusing jobs ... it\u2019s an infernal circle from which you can\u2019t leave.\u201d\n\nWith the worst economic depression since the 1930s looming as a result of the pandemic, the inequalities exposed by coronavirus are clearer than ever, she says: \u201cThe idea that we\u2019re all in the same boat is wrong. Italians without citizenship are left drowning.\u201d\n\nNeves was preparing an appeal against the rejection of his family reunification when civil courts were shut down in March because of Covid-19. No further date for the hearing was communicated. And financial assistance? \u201cForget about it, I don\u2019t even have a health card or ID card any more, I just don\u2019t exist,\u201d he tells me during one of many long strolls alongside the Parco degli Acquedotti, one of Rome\u2019s largest green areas.\n\nFrom this vantage point, we can see the large expanse where Federico Fellini filmed the opening scene of La Dolce Vita. Luca\u2019s story seems closer to that of another masterpiece partly shot here: Mamma Roma, by Pier Paolo Pasolini, whose hero is dramatically brought back to a past she wants to escape. \u201cThis virus was a bitter surprise,\u201d Neves says. \u201cBut I\u2019m used to quarantining; I\u2019ve been doing so for the past 12 years.\u201d"}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/aug/04/labour-dawn-butler-people-threatened-to-kill-me-ive-been-attacked-on-the-tube", "published": "2020-08-04T05:00:01", "title": "Labour's Dawn Butler: 'People threatened to kill me. I\u2019ve been attacked on the tube'", "text": "Her support for Black Lives Matter forced the MP to close her office. She says ending racism is the fight of her generation \u2013 and she has no qualms about upsetting Labour\u2019s leader\n\nAt the start of April, Dawn Butler was a well-liked figure in parliament and looked like a strong candidate for deputy leader of the Labour party. An experienced parliamentarian, 50 years old and a party member for more than 30 of them, she had been a minister in Gordon Brown\u2019s government and served in Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s shadow cabinet. In December 2009, she had been the first black woman to speak from the dispatch box. She also had strong union links, having worked for the GMB and, before that, the Public and Commercial Services Union. She had a life before \u2013 and halfway through \u2013 Westminster, working as a computer programmer and then an employment-service trainer.\n\nIn February 2005, she stood to be a parliamentary candidate in West Ham, in the east London borough of Newham, where she was raised by her mother, who worked for the NHS, and her father, who worked on the railways. She lost that race by four votes. A month later, she went for Brent South, in north-west London, and got it, even though \u201cit had already been earmarked for Tony Blair\u2019s political adviser. That was like a red rag to a bull, wasn\u2019t it? It had already been stitched up for a bloke, so obviously I was going to go for it.\u201d That May, she won the seat in the general election.\n\nAfter boundary changes, she lost the newly minted seat of Brent Central to Sarah Teather in the 2010 Lib Dem bounce, only to be elected again \u2013 in the same constituency \u2013 in 2015, since when she has held the seat. She spent the intervening years designing learning programmes for companies and nursing her father in the last year of his life.\n\nOn 3 April 2020, she lost the deputy leadership race to Angela Rayner \u2013 about which she has views, which we will come to. Since then, she has been a backbencher, working in the same crisis conditions as everyone else. In June, she wrote an opinion piece in the Metro newspaper defending the Black Lives Matter protests. \u201cWe had 6,000 bits of communication and about 2,000 of them were hate communication,\u201d she says of the response. \u201cThere are people calling me every word you can think of \u2013 the C-word, the N-word, the B-world. People threatening to kill me. I\u2019ve been attacked on the tube. People have tried to attack me in my constituency office. A member of staff bought themselves a stab vest to come to my surgery.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018My parents taught me resilience\u2019 ... Butler in her days as a GMB organiser. Photograph: Graham Turner/The Guardian\n\nShe had to close her constituency office because she could not guarantee her staff\u2019s safety. \u201cMy team had to wade through all this and basically grade [the messages], in terms of what Twitter might take down, or Facebook might take down, or the police might take seriously, or parliament might take seriously. And they were broken by all this. They\u2019re protecting me from the hate and I feel so guilty about it.\u201d\n\nWe meet in her constituency, at the Arch, a deserted but intensely festive Indian restaurant in Wembley, where she is sitting in a cabana in the broadest sunshine, looking like a portrait of optimism. It is astonishing to hear, first-hand, about the racist abuse she has endured and to see the contrast between the grind of this nastiness and how undimmed she seems by it.\n\nShe quickly and resolutely diverts from her own experience on to someone whom she thinks has it worse: Diane Abbott, the recipient of almost as much online abuse as all other female MPs combined, according to research by Amnesty International in 2017. \u201cYou have people who\u2019ve made a career out of attacking Diane. What did she have to put up with when she entered parliament [in 1987]? What scars has she got, what did she have to do to keep the peace, how many times did she have to smile through it?\u201d\n\nWhenever people of colour see a wrongful arrest or a killing, it brings back trauma\n\nThere are clear parallels in the way Abbott and Butler are treated, not just by political opponents and trolls on social media, but also by putatively respectable platforms. \u201cThey often try to dismiss what I\u2019m saying, then two or three weeks later everyone else is saying it and I\u2019m exonerated. A presenter said to me: did I read the government\u2019s report [on coronavirus], which was 50 pages. It was only 50 pages anyway because it had such a large font; if they\u2019d printed it at normal size, it would have been a pamphlet. And I was ridiculed for saying I hadn\u2019t. But I didn\u2019t need to read it \u2013 I\u2019d already read the science behind it. I\u2019m on the science and technology select committee.\u201d\n\nShe says this portrayal \u2013 the idiot who is not on top of her brief \u2013 \u201cis a form of trolling. It\u2019s a trope. And it\u2019s racism. It\u2019s something that black women face all the time. We are simultaneously invisible and visible.\u201d This has persisted throughout her life in the public eye, even the most triumphant and historic moments of which have been marked by this kneejerk ridicule. When she stood up to speak on behalf of Brown\u2019s government, \u201cthe first black woman to stand at the dispatch box, the Tories tried to belittle me at that moment in history. I can\u2019t remember his name, but one took great delight in telling me that \u2018upskilling\u2019 was not in the English dictionary. He knew it was a momentous time, but they\u2019d all been instructed to put me down.\u201d\n\nBut the person she remembers vividly from that day is Sadiq Khan, who was a transport minister at the time. \u201cHe ran from the other side of parliament to make sure he sat beside me. He was all out of breath. He said: \u2018I\u2019m not letting you do this by yourself.\u2019\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018When I stood at the dispatch box, he ran from the other side of parliament to make sure he sat beside me\u2019 ... Dawn Butler (fourth left) on the March4Women in London in March 2018, alongside celebrities, activists and other politicians, including the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan (fifth left). Photograph: Jack Taylor/Getty Images\n\nPerhaps because of her five-year hiatus outside parliament, Butler made an easy transition from Brown\u2019s government to Corbyn\u2019s shadow cabinet, from minister for youth affairs to shadow minister for women and equalities. The obvious assumption is that she made a strategic shift in her own politics to fit in with the new order, but the only sign of that in her voting record is that, early on, she voted consistently against an inquiry into the Iraq war, which would have aligned her with the right of the party.\n\nShe rejects that and gives a straightforward, personal reason for those votes: \u201cI never believed in holding an inquiry while we still had troops in Iraq. My brother was in the army and I spoke to him about it. If you held an inquiry while the troops were still out there doing their best to fight for the country, it would have been soul-destroying for them.\u201d\n\nHer analysis is that Labour moved rightwards after 2010: \u201cWhen I came back in 2015, I was a little bit surprised at the sorts of things that the Labour party was comfortable with, like the welfare reform bill [in which Harriet Harman, as interim leader, instructed MPs not to vote against Conservative cuts]. I didn\u2019t understand what had happened in my time away; I was only gone for five years. That\u2019s when I knew that Jeremy Corbyn was going to do well, because he knew who he was and what our values were as a party.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018I knew that I had skills to contribute\u2019 ... on Labour\u2019s front bench in October 2018 with Jeremy Corbyn, then the leader of the party, and Kate Osamor, then the shadow secretary for international development. Photograph: Jessica Taylor/PA\n\nBut Corbyn did not woo her into the shadow cabinet \u2013 she had to break down his door. \u201cHe had a lot of inexperienced people around him and that wasn\u2019t helping us. I knew that I could help him at PMQs; I knew that I had skills to contribute.\u201d Butler\u2019s critique of Corbyn\u2019s time is deeply felt, but quite careful. \u201cThe Labour leaked report [into the party\u2019s handling of antisemitism, which described a closed inner circle around the leader, outside of which was a party so riven that staffers were actively hoping for electoral defeat] cut very deep. I was very bruised by that. The lesson is: you need people around you when you\u2019re in power who will question what you\u2019re doing, because you\u2019ll make better decisions.\u201d\n\nI ask, of course, whether she is glad of Keir Starmer\u2019s victory. \u201cI would have been glad whoever won.\u201d She dissolves into laughter and immediately concedes: \u201cThat\u2019s really a cop-out. Am I glad? Do you know what I think? I think the Labour party\u2019s leadership election system needs to change. I don\u2019t think you should be having an internal election that means you have to spend a lot of money.\u201d\n\nShe then rattles off how much everything costs \u2013 \u00a35,000 to get access to the membership lists, \u00a313,000 to pay for the system to contact members by text, half a million for a mailout. \u201cI thought working 24 hours a day would be enough to win. But, actually, I needed money to access some of the systems that were needed. And I had 30 grand. Before the phone calls and mailouts started, I was in second place.\u201d In the event, Butler came last, on 11%.\n\nThe government is using the virus as a smokescreen for what\u2019s going to happen post-transition\n\nAnother interpretation is that her campaign did not get across who she is. She often used to come across as dry and cautious, with more than a trace of the disciplined minister of government, serious and liable to equivocate. That Butler has vanished: no longer bound by the responsibilities of the frontbench, she relishes the freedom to choose her own causes: \u201cThere are things that I need to speak out on that may make Keir feel uncomfortable.\u201d She also seems to have liberated her personality: funny, zealous, mischievous, pioneering.\n\nHer chosen causes are varied: she has a fairly geeky, careful eye on government procurement, from the contact-tracing app to Chris Grayling\u2019s shipping contract with a company that had no ships. She is viscerally worried about a bad or no-deal Brexit and what it will do to her constituents. \u201cI think a lot of what this government is doing is that they\u2019re using it [the virus] as a smokescreen for what\u2019s going to happen post-transition. And we really have to work hard at informing the public as to what\u2019s actually going on.\u201d\n\nAnd the Black Lives Matter movement \u2013 \u201cIt is a movement, not a moment,\u201d she says, referring to Starmer calling it the latter, for which he later apologised \u2013 \u201chas got me thinking about all kinds of things. Whenever, in general, African-Caribbean people, people of colour, see an injustice taking place, a wrongful arrest or a killing, it brings back trauma, it makes you think of the stuff you\u2019ve been through, or your family has been through. My parents taught me resilience, but it was their resilience. My brothers taught me resistance, how to survive. So they would say to me: \u2018When you\u2019re driving, if a police car drives past you, look in the mirror, see if it turns around to follow you. If it does, stop somewhere where there are people.\u2019\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018I thought working 24 hours a day would be enough to win\u2019 ... campaigning in Durham in February for deputy leader of the Labour party. Photograph: Ian Forsyth/Getty Images\n\nIt is stark to hear, in such concrete terms, the coping strategies that people of colour have developed to counter institutional racism. Butler continues: \u201cThere are loads of people who are, for the first time, understanding the injustice that African-Caribbean people go through. They\u2019re seeing things they never saw before. There are people who are understanding that they have privilege whether they\u2019ve asked for it or not.\u201d\n\nIt is the fight of a generation, she says, but the vastness of it does not put her off identifying the practical solutions she wants now: the resignation of the Metropolitan police commissioner, Cressida Dick, for one. \u201cI work with the police and they want the racist police officers out of the force the same way I do. But if you\u2019ve got the head of the force refusing to acknowledge anything\u2019s wrong, that\u2019s never going to happen. She doesn\u2019t accept the terminology \u2018institutional racism\u2019. If she doesn\u2019t accept it, how can she be committed to eradicate it from her police force?\u201d\n\nButler is also calling for an end to stop and search. \u201cIt does not work \u2013 or rather, it works the way it\u2019s designed to work \u2013 it is designed to be discriminatory. The fact is, where a police officer can stop a person of colour driving a car, saying: \u2018We smelled drugs coming from your car; that\u2019s why we stopped you,\u2019 and then, when they search the car, there are no drugs, you have to ask yourself: what were they smelling?\u201d\n\nButler is adamant that she wants a life after Westminster \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t want to be wheeled out\u201d \u2013 but she has unfinished business: \u201cthe eradication of racism. We live in a topsy-turvy world where it\u2019s a sin to call someone racist, but not a sin to be racist.\u201d Plus, \u201cI made a commitment to myself, when I was elected to parliament, that I would ensure there would be other African-Caribbean women coming behind me. There\u2019s no point in being the only one. It\u2019s too much of a burden for one person to carry and we won\u2019t see change.\u201d"}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/gallery/2020/aug/05/horses-and-illuminations-in-india-wednesdays-best-photos", "published": "2020-08-05T11:46:06", "title": "Running horses and Indian illuminations: Wednesday's best photos", "text": "Ayodhya, India Temples and other buildings on the bank of Sarayu River are illuminated before a foundation-laying ceremony for a Hindu temple\n\nPhotograph: Pawan Kumar/Reuters"}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2020/aug/05/beirut-explosion-aftermath-lebanon-in-pictures", "published": "2020-08-05T08:12:51", "title": "The aftermath of the explosion in Beirut \u2013 in pictures", "text": "Lebanon is in mourning and surveying the damage to its capital, Beirut, after a massive explosion ripped through the city\u2019s port and surrounding areas on Tuesday.

In a sign of the extreme levels of uncertainty around jobs numbers in the pandemic era, economists surveyed by Dow Jones forecast a 1 million jobs gain.\n\nThe economic disruption from the coronavirus has made it far more difficult to measure or predict changes in the U.S. labor market. ADP\u2019s recent numbers have been off by millions when compared with the Labor Department\u2019s monthly report on the employment situation.

I\u2019m sorry, what did you say? You can\u2019t speak about somebody to me that way,\u2019 so being able to not suddenly become the radical that you are not, but in your heart being able to live out from the heart space that you\u2019re in right now you\u2019re opening up the aperture of your own understanding so to be able to just just just meet people where they are.\u201d\n\nThe Oprah Conversation\n\nIn the previous episode, Winfrey described \u201cwhiteness\u201d and \u201cwhite privilege\u201d as sociological phenomena benefiting all whites in a racial \u201ccaste system\u201d in the U.S.\n\nWhite people have a unique role in combating \u201cracism,\u201d maintained Winfrey in the latest episode. \u201cYou all are the ones who are going to be able to change the way your friends, your colleagues, your white family members begin to see racial injustice and racial inequities in this country.

You have second-degree murder, heat of passion, but if you keep moving down the line, you have manslaughter [and] involuntary manslaughter.\u201d\n\nAcho continued\n\n\u201cWhile it is not the same thing as first-degree murder, it\u2019s still an unlawful act that kills someone. In the same breath, there are degrees of racism. While we might not have first-degree racism, anymore, we still have third degree racism, which I draw the parallel to involuntary manslaughter. You\u2019re not physically killing them, you may be emotionally killing them.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo your children may just end up committing involuntary racism if you don\u2019t educate them as to the legalities \u2014 so to speak, if I can continue with my analogy \u2014 the legality, so to speak, of racism, and that is why it\u2019s best to educate and to expose them to that,\u201d the NFL player said.\n\n\u201cI think you do have first-degree racism, still [in America]. Ask that young man who was just caught in the park in Indianapolis, and they were trying to put a noose around him.

It was reportedly sailing under a Moldovan flag with a mostly Ukrainian crew at the time.\n\nOther sources report the ship sailed from Georgia (in eastern Europe) and was bound for Mozambique when it docked in Beirut.\n\nThe onetime captain of the Rhosus, Boris Prokoshev, confirmed to RFE that his former ship was the likely source of the confiscated fertilizer cargo.\n\nProkoshev said he and the crew ended up stranded in Lebanon because Grechuskhkin stopped paying their salaries or fees for operating the ship, which evidently prompted Lebanese officials to seize the cargo. The former captain strongly criticized the Lebanese government for failing to take proper safety measures for the dangerous fertilizer and for leaving it to rot in storage long after Grechushkin lost interest in his seized cargo.\n\nAs for the fire that detonated the six-year-old stash of ammonium nitrate, Lebanese media reported on Wednesday that welders working to repair a breach in the walls of the warehouse might have inadvertently sparked the blaze. The precise cause of the smaller detonations visible in the burning port district before the apocalyptic blast that horrified the world is still under investigation.\n\nThe Crimean Maritime Bulletin on Wednesday confirmed the details about MV Rhosus and its cargo, elaborating that Lebanese officials impounded the ship because it failed safety inspections and prevented the crew from returning home because they were afraid they would be \u201cleft with an abandoned vessel on their hands, loaded with dangerous cargo,\u201d a fear that evidently came true.\n\nThe Maritime Bulletin\u2019s sources expressed some confusion as to why the Lebanese government did not seize the vessel and man it with a temporary crew. The ultimate fate of the ship was uncertain as of Wednesday morning, as some eyewitnesses claim to have seen a burning ship in the Beirut harbor on Tuesday that might have been the Rhosus, but former captain Prokoshev said it eventually sailed out of Beirut and sank years ago due to poor maintenance.\n\nReuters quoted sources at the Port of Beirut on Wednesday who blamed sheer \u201cnegligence\u201d for leaving the ammonium nitrate stored unsafely in a warehouse for six years, despite prescient warnings it could \u201cblow up all of Beirut\u201d if it should ever catch on fire. In the event, the explosion on Tuesday was not only powerful enough to severely damage the Port of Beirut and the entire city, it actually changed the coastline.\n\nThe general manager of the port and Lebanon\u2019s customs director both said the cargo was kept at the warehouse under a court order despite requests for it to be \u201cre-exported\u201d and a general understanding that the substance was dangerous.\n\n\u201cWe requested that it be re-exported but that did not happen. We leave it to the experts and those concerned to determine why,\u201d customs director Badri Daher told local media, pointing the first of what is certain to be many fingers as Lebanon\u2019s unsteady government attempts to distribute blame for the incident.\n\nReuters discovered four documented requests for re-export of the material on the grounds that its presence endangered the safety of the port, one filed each year between 2015 and 2017.\n\nThe Siberian Times on Wednesday published photos from 2014 showing crew aboard the Rhosus using signs to plead with Lebanese authorities to let them go home. The article said Igor Grechushkin declared bankruptcy soon after the Rhosus was seized and currently lives in Cyprus with his wife, while their son attends a university in Scotland. Grechushkin has thus far declined requests to be interviewed about the Beirut explosion.", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/08/05/beirut-blast-blamed-on-explosive-cargo-seized-from-russian-ship/", "published": "2020-08-05T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Iranian Media: U.S. \u2018Sabotage\u2019 May Have Caused Lebanon Blast", "text": "The Iranian news agency Mehr published an article Wednesday speculating that the deadly explosion that destroyed large parts of Beirut, Lebanon, the day before was the product of U.S. \u201csabotage.\u201d\n\nMehr, the propaganda arm of Iran\u2019s Islamic Ideology Dissemination Organization (IIDO), also gave space on its English-language website to a speculative column asserting, \u201cEven if we accept that the Israelis and the United States were not involved in the Beirut bombing and put aside the possibility of any sabotage plan, they will certainly not ignore this opportunity to seek their political exploitation.\u201d\n\nA giant blast near Beirut\u2019s port incinerated much of the city on Tuesday, leaving a large cloud of red, orange, and purple smoke and resulting in at least 100 deaths, according to the Lebanese Red Cross. Thousands were injured, though tallying a precise number has proved difficult for authorities as several of the city\u2019s clinics and hospitals were damaged in the blast, resulting in bleeding civilians running through town seeking medical help anywhere. Seismologists reported that the blast emulated the power of a 3.5 magnitude earthquake and could be felt nearly 200 miles away.\n\nLebanese authorities announced that preliminary investigations suggested the explosion was the result of the detonation of a cache of nearly 3,000 tons of ammonium nitrate stored with few safety precautions at a warehouse near the port. The color of the smoke plumes appears to corroborate that nitrates were involved. Prime Minister Hassan Diab told reporters the material had been stored there for six years after being confiscated and that the government had no explanation for why no one had bothered to move highly dangerous material from a highly trafficked area.\n\nDespite Lebanese officials denying that they had any evidence of terrorism or intentional detonation \u2014 and no evidence of an airstrike or any aerial activity triggering the blast \u2014 Mehr News proposed that U.S. warplanes may have bombed the harbor.\n\nMehr\u2019s article, \u201cPossibility of U.S. Sabotage in Beirut Explosion,\u201d used unsourced images that appeared to be from a radar system showing various planes in flight near the harbor to make the cases that \u201cunusual\u201d American Navy patrols had occurred on the Lebanon-Syrian coastline at the time of the explosion. The low-resolution alleged radar images do not appear to have any timestamp on them, so it is impossible to tell when these planes were in the sky, and appear to have been taken from a Russian satellite system.

It\u2019s hakaras hatov,\u201d using the Hebrew words for gratitude.\n\nKamenetsky, head of the renowned Talmudical Yeshiva of Philadelphia, sits on the rabbinical advisory board of Agudath Israel of America, the ultra-Orthodox world\u2019s leading lobbying and advocacy organization.\n\nThough the majority of American Jews vote for Democrats, the Orthodox Jewish community has increasingly favored Republican candidates in recent years. While, in 2013, a Pew Research Center survey found that 64 percent of ultra-Orthodox Jews considered themselves to be politically conservative; in 2018, 91 percent of Orthodox Jews surveyed by Jewish weekly Ami Magazine gave President Trump favorable ratings \u2014 with 82 percent saying they would support him again in 2020.\n\nFollow Joshua Klein on Twitter @JoshuaKlein.", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/08/04/top-american-rabbinical-leader-unequivocally-endorses-trump/", "published": "2020-08-04T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Photos: 'Devastated' Beirut Emerges from the Ashes of Deadly Explosion", "text": "A massive explosion rocked Beirut on Tuesday, flattening much of the city\u2019s port, damaging buildings across the capital, and sending a giant mushroom cloud into the sky. More than 70 people were killed and 3,000 injured, with bodies buried in the rubble, officials said.\n\nIt was not clear what caused the blast, which struck with the force of a 3.5 magnitude earthquake, according to Germany\u2019s geosciences center GFZ, and was heard and felt as far away as Cyprus more than 180 miles across the Mediterranean.\n\nLebanon\u2019s Interior Minister Mohammed Fahmi told a local TV station that it appeared the blast was caused by the detonation of more than 2,700 tons of ammonium nitrate that had been stored in a warehouse at the dock ever since it was confiscated from a cargo ship in 2014.

Current NCC was about $8.8 billion. 10% of that would be stripped away and barred from any law enforcement, legal system use etc. About $3.7 billion in NCC went to those departments this year. \u2014 Bill Melugin (@BillFOXLA) August 4, 2020\n\nThe proposal includes a measure to use racial criteria in determining government funding of businesses, described as \u201caccess to capital for small minority-owned businesses, with a focus on Black-owned businesses.\u201d It also prescribes the use of \u201ccommunity-based restorative justice\u201d among its \u201calternatives to incarceration.\u201d\n\nThe proposal\u2019s section addressing the defunding of law enforcement includes the following language:\n\nEnsure that the ordinance containing the proposed charter amendment is clear that the use of any of these earmarked funds for carceral systems and any law enforcement agencies, including the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department, L.A. County District Attorney\u2019s Office, L.A. County Superior Courts, or L.A. County Probation Department, including redistribution of funds through these agencies, is strictly forbidden.\n\nCity supervisors voting for the proposal are responding to the Black Lives Matter campaign and organization, Streetsblog reported. \u201cReimagine L.A. is one of a number of pushes locally to respond to Black Lives Matter protest demands to defund the police. Metro is taking steps toward shifting resources toward services and away from armed law enforcement. L.A. City and a few smaller cities have some initiatives that would also shift some funding.\u201d\n\nThe initiative was approved by Supervisors Hilda Solis, Sheila Kuehl, Mark Ridley-Thomas, and Janice Hahn.

Although the resolution passed the House on a bipartisan vote, it is unclear if it will receive similar support in the United States Senate.\n\nBiden\u2019s endorsement of the museum also comes as the presumptive nominee seeks to boost his standing among Latino voters ahead of the general election.\n\nSince jumping into the 2020 race, the former vice president has struggled to expand his support among the demographic, especially younger Latinos, many of whom favored Sen.

Many of the latest scams take advantage of the coronavirus by impersonating government officials and health authorities.\n\nHackers are also setting up a great number of malicious, virus-infested domains that lure victims by offering information about the coronavirus.

Republican and conservative voters are the major exceptions, with 88% of Republican voters and 84% of those identifying as very conservative in politics backing the President\u2019s re-election. The Poll estimates that the shape of the likely electorate in California this fall will clearly favor the Democrats, with 48% of those considered likely to vote being registered Democrats and just 26% registered Republicans. The survey also finds that 13% of the likely voters include those who are newly registered to vote since the last statewide general election. The preferences of these new voters mirror those of the overall electorate, with 67% backing Biden, 25% supporting Trump and 8% undecided.\n\nThese poll results provide indications about the roll California is likely to play in the outcome of the presidential election and the battle for control of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2020.\n\nWhile there is no doubt that California will vote for Joe Biden in 2020, and his current 39 point margin suggests that win in the state will be by more than a 2-to-1 margin, the size of that margin may give a false indication as to the significance of Biden\u2019s current popular vote lead over the president\u2013which, according to the Real Clear Politics Average of Polls, now stands at 7.4 percent\u2013when it comes to the margin that matters in the electoral college vote.\n\nAs our Constitution states, the winner of the presidential election is determined by which candidate receives the majority of electoral college votes cast, which in 2020 will mean at least 270 votes out of the 538 electoral college votes up for grabs.\n\nWhen it comes to the outcome of the presidential election, it seems likely that the popular vote results are likely to be even more skewed from the electoral college results than they were in 2016.\n\nIn 2016, when she won California by 30 points \u2013 4.3 million votes more than Donald Trump \u2013 Hillary Clinton lost the electoral college vote on election day by 306 to 232, despite winning the popular vote by two points, 48 percent to 46 percent. Had Hillary won California by 39 points in 2016, her raw vote margin over Trump would have been 1.2 million more, or 5.5 million, and she would have won the popular votes by four percentage points, 49 percent to 45 percent, but still lost the electoral college vote by the same election day margin of 306 to 232. (Note, due to seven faithless electors, the final electoral college vote was 304 for Trump and 227 for Clinton.)\n\nSince California is one of 48 states that have a winner-take-all system when it comes to the awarding of electors in the presidential contest, the state\u2019s 55 electoral college votes will be allocated to the winner whether that candidate wins by a margin of a single vote or a margin of 5.5 million votes.\n\nWhen it comes to the presidential contest, the poll makes clear voter preferences for presidential candidates in California at present turn on two key issues: (1) Black Lives Matter and (2) attitudes towards the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\u201cThere is a direct relationship between voter appraisals of the President with two issues that are now dominating the news: the Black Lives Matter movement and health threat posed by the coronavirus,\u201d the analysis accompanying the poll released stated.\n\nWith regards to Black Lives Matter:\n\nThe Poll finds that 65% of likely voters in California have a favorable opinion of the Black Lives Matter movement, while 30% view it unfavorably. Among the two-thirds majority who hold positive views of the Black Lives Matter movement nearly all (96%) disapprove of the job Trump is doing as president and 93% are backing Biden for president. By contrast, among the 30% of likely voters who hold an unfavorable opinion of the Black Lives Matter movement 85% approve of the President\u2019s performance and 83% are backing his reelection.\n\nSimilarly, attitudes about the coronavirus pandemic were a referendum on President Trump\u2019s leadership:\n\nAmong the two-thirds majority who view the health threat from the virus as becoming more serious 87% disapprove of the job Trump is doing as president and 84% are backing Biden in the presidential election. Voters who view the health threat as remaining the same are evenly divided in their appraisals of Trump\u2019s performance as president and only narrowly support his re-election. By contrast, among the 12% of voters who feel the health threat posed by the virus is becoming less serious in their area, 89% approve of Trump\u2019s overall performance in office and back his re-election 87% to 10%.\n\nIf voters in California appear on a track to reject Republican candidates on the ballot from top to bottom, it may make the GOP\u2019s attempts to take back the majority in the House of Representatives even more difficult.\n\nPrior to the 2018 mid-term elections, Republicans controlled the House in the 115th Congress by a 236 to 196 margin, with 14 of those Republican seats in California:\n\nRep. Doug LaMalfa (R-CA-1) Tom McClintock (R-CA-4) Rep. Paul Cook (R-CA-8) Rep. Jeff Denham (R-CA-10) Rep. David Valadao (R-CA-21) Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA-22) Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA-23) Rep. Steve Knight (R-CA-25) Rep. Ed Royce (R-CA-39) Rep. Ken Calvert (R-CA-42) Rep. Mimi Walters (R-CA-45) Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA-48) Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA-49) Rep. Duncan D. Hunter (R-CA-50)\n\nThirty-nine of the state\u2019s 53 seats at the beginning of the 115th Congress were held by Democrats.\n\nIn the 2018 midterms, Democrats won seven California Congressional Districts previously represented by Republicans, while Republicans failed to win a single California Congressional District previously represented by Democrats. These Democrat victories in California helped flip the House at the beginning of the 116th Congress to Democrat control by a 235 to 199 margin.\n\nOnly six of the state\u2019s 53 seats in the House of Representatives are currently held by Republicans:\n\nRep. Doug LaMalfa (R-CA-1) Tom McClintock (R-CA-4) Rep. Paul Cook (R-CA-8) Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA-22) Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA-23) Rep. Ken Calvert (R-CA-42)\n\nOne seat formerly held by a Republican (the 50th Congressional District) is vacant, and 46 are held by Democrats.\n\nA Republican takeover of the House of Representatives hinges on the ability of Republicans to take back many, if not all, of the eight seats lost in California to the Democrats in 2018, and perhaps taking back even more.\n\nThe across the board rejection of Republican candidates reported in the Berkeley IGS Poll, if predictive, however, does not bode well for such a Republican comeback in the House races in the Golden State.\n\nHowever, those poll results are belied by the results of the May special election in Califorina\u2019s 25th Congressional District, where Republican candidate Mike Garcia flipped the seat from Democrat control, after former Rep. Katie Hill (D-CA-25) resigned in disgrace over allegations of personal misconduct. Hill was one of the Democrat candidates who flipped a seat from Republican control in the 2018 mid-term elections.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported:\n\nGarcia, a former military pilot, defeated his Democrat opponent Christy Smith (D-Santa Clarita) in a special election to fill a House seat once held by Democrat Katie Hill in Southern California. \u201cI do believe there has been a renaissance and an awakening from the general public, not just Republicans, but Americans in general \u2014 that we really do need to pay attention to who we\u2019re voting for \u2026 and this district is an extremely purple district,\u201d Garcia said in response to a question from Breitbart News Editor-at-Large Rebecca Mansour regarding what his being elected means for national elections. Garcia also said he believes his being elected is \u201can opportunity of a lifetime for 2020.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m in the northern LA county with Santa Clarita, Antelope Valley, Simi Valley, and Ventura County,\u201d Garcia explained. \u201cSo as far as registered voters it\u2019s maybe only 25 to 30 percent Republican, but what it represents is folks understanding the message and the values and understanding that we\u2019ve gotta hire people for these jobs that are competent, qualified, and know how to run a business, and are running for the right reasons as patriots and not any self-serving motives or political agenda. I think people are recognizing that. I think that this is truly an opportunity of a lifetime for 2020, for our party, for conservatives in general. \u2026 I think we have an opportunity to get the house back, but we\u2019ve got to continue to work our tails off to make sure that that happens and not take it for granted.\u201d\n\nThe Berkeley IGS Poll of 6,756 likely California voters was conducted online between July 21 and July 27 and has a 2 percent margin of error.", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/08/04/california-poll-biden-leads-trump-by-39-points-nine-more-than-hillary-in-2016/", "published": "2020-08-04T00:00:00"}, {"title": "CA Poll: Biden Leads Trump by 39 Points, 9 More than Hillary in 2016", "text": "Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden leads President Donald Trump by 39 points in California, 67 percent to 28 percent, according to a Berkeley IGS (Institute of Governmental Studies) poll released on Tuesday.\n\nBiden\u2019s current poll margin is nine points higher than Hillary Clinton\u2019s 30 point margin, 61 percent to 31 percent, over Trump in California in the 2016 presidential election, when she secured 8.7 million votes in the state to Trump\u2019s 4.4 million \u2013 another sign that the most populous state in the country is becoming increasingly radicalized as a far left one-party state.\n\nKey findings of the poll:\n\nBiden\u2019s huge thirty-nine percentage point advantage over Trump among Californians likely to vote in the November presidential election is very broad-based, with majorities of voters in all regions of the state and across virtually all major demographic subgroups of the likely voter population.

The preferences of these new voters mirror those of the overall electorate, with 67% backing Biden, 25% supporting Trump and 8% undecided.\n\nThese poll results provide indications about the roll California is likely to play in the outcome of the presidential election and the battle for control of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2020.\n\nWhile there is no doubt that California will vote for Joe Biden in 2020, and his current 39 point margin suggests that win in the state will be by more than a 2-to-1 margin, the size of that margin may give a false indication as to the significance of Biden\u2019s current popular vote lead over the president\u2013which, according to the Real Clear Politics Average of Polls, now stands at 7.4 percent\u2013when it comes to the margin that matters in the electoral college vote.\n\nAs our Constitution states, the winner of the presidential election is determined by which candidate receives the majority of electoral college votes cast, which in 2020 will mean at least 270 votes out of the 538 electoral college votes up for grabs.\n\nWhen it comes to the outcome of the presidential election, it seems likely that the popular vote results are likely to be even more skewed from the electoral college results than they were in 2016.\n\nIn 2016, when she won California by 30 points \u2013 4.3 million votes more than Donald Trump \u2013 Hillary Clinton lost the electoral college vote on election day by 306 to 232, despite winning the popular vote by two points, 48 percent to 46 percent. Had Hillary won California by 39 points in 2016, her raw vote margin over Trump would have been 1.2 million more, or 5.5 million, and she would have won the popular votes by four percentage points, 49 percent to 45 percent, but still lost the electoral college vote by the same election day margin of 306 to 232. (Note, due to seven faithless electors, the final electoral college vote was 304 for Trump and 227 for Clinton.)\n\nSince California is one of 48 states that have a winner-take-all system when it comes to the awarding of electors in the presidential contest, the state\u2019s 55 electoral college votes will be allocated to the winner whether that candidate wins by a margin of a single vote or a margin of 5.5 million votes.\n\nWhen it comes to the presidential contest, the poll makes clear voter preferences for presidential candidates in California at present turn on two key issues: (1) Black Lives Matter and (2) attitudes towards the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\u201cThere is a direct relationship between voter appraisals of the President with two issues that are now dominating the news: the Black Lives Matter movement and health threat posed by the coronavirus,\u201d the analysis accompanying the poll released stated.\n\nWith regards to Black Lives Matter:\n\nThe Poll finds that 65% of likely voters in California have a favorable opinion of the Black Lives Matter movement, while 30% view it unfavorably. Among the two-thirds majority who hold positive views of the Black Lives Matter movement nearly all (96%) disapprove of the job Trump is doing as president and 93% are backing Biden for president. By contrast, among the 30% of likely voters who hold an unfavorable opinion of the Black Lives Matter movement 85% approve of the President\u2019s performance and 83% are backing his reelection.\n\nSimilarly, attitudes about the coronavirus pandemic were a referendum on President Trump\u2019s leadership:\n\nAmong the two-thirds majority who view the health threat from the virus as becoming more serious 87% disapprove of the job Trump is doing as president and 84% are backing Biden in the presidential election. Voters who view the health threat as remaining the same are evenly divided in their appraisals of Trump\u2019s performance as president and only narrowly support his re-election. By contrast, among the 12% of voters who feel the health threat posed by the virus is becoming less serious in their area, 89% approve of Trump\u2019s overall performance in office and back his re-election 87% to 10%.\n\nIf voters in California appear on a track to reject Republican candidates on the ballot from top to bottom, it may make the GOP\u2019s attempts to take back the majority in the House of Representatives even more difficult.\n\nPrior to the 2018 mid-term elections, Republicans controlled the House in the 115th Congress by a 236 to 196 margin, with 14 of those Republican seats in California:\n\nRep. Doug LaMalfa (R-CA-1) Tom McClintock (R-CA-4) Rep. Paul Cook (R-CA-8) Rep. Jeff Denham (R-CA-10) Rep. David Valadao (R-CA-21) Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA-22) Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA-23) Rep. Steve Knight (R-CA-25) Rep. Ed Royce (R-CA-39) Rep. Ken Calvert (R-CA-42) Rep. Mimi Walters (R-CA-45) Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA-48) Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA-49) Rep. Duncan D. Hunter (R-CA-50)\n\nThirty-nine of the state\u2019s 53 seats at the beginning of the 115th Congress were held by Democrats.\n\nIn the 2018 midterms, Democrats won seven California Congressional Districts previously represented by Republicans, while Republicans failed to win a single California Congressional District previously represented by Democrats. These Democrat victories in California helped flip the House at the beginning of the 116th Congress to Democrat control by a 235 to 199 margin.\n\nOnly six of the state\u2019s 53 seats in the House of Representatives are currently held by Republicans:\n\nRep. Doug LaMalfa (R-CA-1) Tom McClintock (R-CA-4) Rep. Paul Cook (R-CA-8) Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA-22) Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA-23) Rep. Ken Calvert (R-CA-42)\n\nOne seat formerly held by a Republican (the 50th Congressional District) is vacant, and 46 are held by Democrats.\n\nA Republican takeover of the House of Representatives hinges on the ability of Republicans to take back many, if not all, of the eight seats lost in California to the Democrats in 2018, and perhaps taking back even more.\n\nThe across the board rejection of Republican candidates reported in the Berkeley IGS Poll, if predictive, however, does not bode well for such a Republican comeback in the House races in the Golden State.\n\nHowever, those poll results are belied by the results of the May special election in Califorina\u2019s 25th Congressional District, where Republican candidate Mike Garcia flipped the seat from Democrat control, after former Rep. Katie Hill (D-CA-25) resigned in disgrace over allegations of personal misconduct. Hill was one of the Democrat candidates who flipped a seat from Republican control in the 2018 mid-term elections.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported:\n\nGarcia, a former military pilot, defeated his Democrat opponent Christy Smith (D-Santa Clarita) in a special election to fill a House seat once held by Democrat Katie Hill in Southern California. \u201cI do believe there has been a renaissance and an awakening from the general public, not just Republicans, but Americans in general \u2014 that we really do need to pay attention to who we\u2019re voting for \u2026 and this district is an extremely purple district,\u201d Garcia said in response to a question from Breitbart News Editor-at-Large Rebecca Mansour regarding what his being elected means for national elections. Garcia also said he believes his being elected is \u201can opportunity of a lifetime for 2020.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m in the northern LA county with Santa Clarita, Antelope Valley, Simi Valley, and Ventura County,\u201d Garcia explained. \u201cSo as far as registered voters it\u2019s maybe only 25 to 30 percent Republican, but what it represents is folks understanding the message and the values and understanding that we\u2019ve gotta hire people for these jobs that are competent, qualified, and know how to run a business, and are running for the right reasons as patriots and not any self-serving motives or political agenda. I think people are recognizing that. I think that this is truly an opportunity of a lifetime for 2020, for our party, for conservatives in general. \u2026 I think we have an opportunity to get the house back, but we\u2019ve got to continue to work our tails off to make sure that that happens and not take it for granted.\u201d\n\nThe Berkeley IGS Poll of 6,756 likely California voters was conducted online between July 21 and July 27 and has a 2 percent margin of error.", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/08/04/california-poll-biden-leads-trump-by-39-points-nine-more-than-hillary-in-2016/#disqus_thread", "published": "2020-08-04T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Donald Trump: Beirut Explosion \u2018Looks Like a Terrible Attack\u2019", "text": "President Donald Trump reacted to the massive explosion in Beirut, Lebanon, on the capital city\u2019s waterfront.\n\n\u201cIt looks like a terrible attack,\u201d Trump said during a press conference at the White House on Tuesday.\n\nHe said that he met with his generals to discuss the explosion and they estimated the explosion was an attack.\n\n\u201cThis was not some kind of manufacturing explosion type of event,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThis was a \u2014 seems to be, according to them.

One published in The Lancet on June 1, 2020 said masks and respirators reduced the risk of infection by anywhere from 78 percent to 85 percent,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYour guess is as good as any: 50 percent to 75 percent or 80 percent is probably correct,\u201d he added.\n\nNotably, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director has signaled opposition to a controlled study on the effectiveness of masks.\n\n\u201cI would not want to do a randomized controlled study because that would mean having people not wear masks and see if they do better,\u201d Fauci said during a discussion with students at Georgetown University\u2019s Institute of Politics and Public Service.\n\n\u201cRight now, I\u2019m convinced enough in the summation and totality of the data that has been analyzed by meta-analysis that I\u2019m convinced that the benefit of wearing a mask clearly is there and is better than not wearing a mask,\u201d he explained.\n\nFauci recently made headlines after photos emerged that showed the White House Coronavirus Task Force Member going maskless in D.C., with his mask draped around his chin at the Washington Nationals\u2019 season opener:\n\nAnd there\u2019s Dr. Anthony Fauci showing us all he knows exactly how well masks work!

The Walt Disney Co. said Tuesday that it will debut its live-action blockbuster on its subscription streaming service, Disney+, on Sept. 4.\n\nBut this is no \u201cHamilton\u201d: Customers will have to pay an additional $29.99 on top of the cost of the monthly subscription to rent \u201cMulan.\u201d The company plans to release it in theaters in areas where Disney+ is not available.\n\n\u201cIn order to meet the needs of consumers during this unpredictable period, we thought it was important to find alternative ways to bring this exceptional family-friendly film to them in a timely manner,\u201d Disney CEO Bob Chapek said on the company\u2019s earnings call. \u201cWe see this as an opportunity to bring this incredible film to a broad audience currently unable to go to movie theaters.\u201d\n\nThe live-action remake of the animated film was one of the first major films to be affected by the coronavirus pandemic. Originally set for a March 27 release, \u201cMulan\u201d moved to late July, then late August and was then pulled from the calendar all together as COVID-19 cases spiked through the U.S.\n\nAlong with Warner Bros.\u2019 \u201cTenet,\u201d \u201cMulan\u201d was going to be one of the first major movies to open in theaters since the shutdown. Exhibitors, most of which have been closed for over four months, have been desperate for new films that would help draw wary audiences back to theaters.\n\nBut while Warner Bros. is moving forward with a theatrical release plan, which involves opening \u201cTenet\u201d internationally first and then in select U.S. theaters a week later, on Sept. 3, Disney decided to pivot and direct consumers to its streaming service.\n\nIt is not unprecedented for a major studio to offer a premium video on demand release during the pandemic. Universal Pictures debuted \u201cTrolls World Tour\u201d on streaming in April while most theaters were shuttered. Although it caused a major rift at the time, it has since led to an historic compromise between the nation\u2019s largest theater chain and Universal to shrink its theatrical window to 17 days.\n\nBut few expected \u201cMulan,\u201d a $200 million production, to go this route, even Disney. In late June, when announcing its delay to August, Disney executives Alan Horn and Alan Bergman wrote in a joint statement that \u201cMulan\u201d was, \u201cEverything the cinematic experience should be, and that\u2019s where we believe it belongs\u2014on the world stage and the big screen for audiences around the globe to enjoy together.\u201d", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2020/08/05/disney-to-release-mulan-on-streaming-for-30-in-september/", "published": "2020-08-05T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Nolte: Brian Stelter Is Gaslighting You About CNN\u2019s Push for Biden to Skip Debates", "text": "After far-left CNN aired a segment urging Joe Biden to skip the presidential debates, CNNLOL\u2019s Brian Stelter falsely claimed this narrative is fueled by \u201cright-wing media.\u201d\n\nYes, the basement-rated Stelter, a left-wing anti-Trump activist and a proven liar who regularly spreads conspiracy theories, was again shining his gaslight Monday night with another deliberate attempt to deceive the public.\n\nResponding to a tweet where Townhall\u2019s Guy Benson asked, \u201cThis \u2018Biden shouldn\u2019t debate\u2019 boomlet is just a media tempest, right? Right?,\u201d Stelter responded with, \u201cIt is mostly a right-wing media tempest, fueled by hour after hour of Fox commentary (not reporting), far removed from campaign reality\u2026\u201d\n\nAnd yet it was just a couple days ago when former Bill Clinton Press Secretary Joe Lockhart appeared on CNNLOL to urge Biden to skip the debates.\n\nOh, and Lockhart\u2019s CNNLOL appearance happened just days after Lockhart published a piece urging Biden to skip the debates at \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 CNNLOL [emphasis original].\n\nWhatever you do, don\u2019t debate Trump. Trump has now made more than 20,000 misleading or false statements according to the Washington Post. It\u2019s a fool\u2019s errand to enter the ring with someone who can\u2019t follow the rules or the truth. Biden will undoubtedly take heat from Republicans and the media for skipping the debates. But it\u2019s worth the risk as trying to debate someone incapable of telling the truth is an impossible contest to win.\n\nBut wait. There\u2019s more\u2026\n\nOver this same weekend, the far-left New York Times published an op-ed urging the cancellation of this year\u2019s presidential debates. On top of that, whatever is left of the far-left Newsweek also published a piece about the boomlet of support for the idea of Biden skipping the debates.\n\nA number of Democrats, including Bill Kristol, are urging that the debates be canceled.\n\nA former senior adviser to Hillary Clinton agrees: \u201cBiden shouldn\u2019t feel obligated to throw Trump a lifeline by granting him any debates at all. This is not a normal presidential election and Trump is not a legitimate candidate,\u201d Zac Petkanas tweeted last week.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Thomas Friedman, an anti-Trump New York Times columnist, who urged Biden just last week not to debate the president unless Trump agrees to \u201ctwo conditions.\u201d Of course those conditions are ridiculous \u2014 Trump must release his tax returns and agree to \u201creal-time fact checking\u201d during the debate \u2014 and will never be agreed to, and therefore ensure there will be no debates.\n\nSo there\u2019s no question Biden supporters and the media are colluding to lay the groundwork for Biden to announce a withdrawal from the debates in a way that will do the least amount of damage to his presidential campaign. So the question is, why is Brian Stelter lying about this being the product of the right-wing media?\n\nWell, I think there are two reasons\u2026\n\nThe first is that Stelter is a liar and sometimes liars just lie to lie, for the pure enjoyment of it, out of habit.\n\nSecondly, I don\u2019t think it took very long for media elites to figure out that trying to help Biden weasel out of the debates is damaging to Biden. Regardless of their absurd excuses to justify annihilating a 60-year tradition, the narrative is backfiring; it further exposes Biden as weak and timid, and now everyone regrets floating the idea. So\u2026\n\nThey sent Tater out to lie about the source of the idea, to blame-shift, because that\u2019s what Tater does: he lies, he serially sacrifices his integrity for The Cause. He\u2019s more than happy to make a brazen fool of himself if it means a pat on the head from CNNLOL chief Jeff Zucker.\n\nStelter is the left\u2019s stooge, their crash-test dummy.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

The suggestion by the office of the district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., came in a new federal court filing arguing that Mr. Trump\u2019s accountants should have to comply with a subpoena seeking eight years of his personal and corporate tax returns. Mr. Trump had asked a judge to declare the subpoena invalid. \u2026 In the new filing, the prosecutors did not directly identify the subject of their inquiry. But they said that \u201cundisputed\u201d assertions in earlier court papers and several news reports about Mr. Trump\u2019s business practices showed that the office had a wide legal basis for the subpoena. \u2026 They cited newspaper investigations that concluded the president may have illegally inflated his net worth and the value of his properties to lenders and insurers. They also included an article on the congressional testimony of his former lawyer and fixer, Michael D. Cohen, who told lawmakers last year that the president had committed insurance fraud. Lawyers for the president have denied wrongdoing.\n\nThe links above all refer to reporting by the New York Times, which apparently is the source for Vance\u2019s claims of possible fraud.\n\nVance\u2019s filing comes after the Supreme Court ruled in a pair of cases last month that the president could not demand that local prosecutors meet a heightened burden for an ordinary subpoena, but that Congress did not have the right to demand whatever documents it wanted of the president.\n\nJoel B.

But the accident caused Mr. Nadler to be an hour late to the hearing.\n\nWatching Mr. Nadler during that hearing, which starred Attorney General William Barr, you might think he had hit his head in the accident. But, alas, Mr. Nadler was already that dumb. Even before the accident, he was severely damaged goods.\n\nThat said, it is always unwise to underestimate Mr. Nadler. Just ask House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, the slender California Democrat with a long neck.\n\nIn a race to a microphone on the Senate floor earlier this year during the impeachment proceedings, Mr. Schiff thought he could just take his time and slowly saunter over. Something about Mr. Nadler made Mr. Schiff think he could play rabbit to Mr. Nadler\u2019s tortoise to the microphone.\n\nWith a microphone serving as the carrot, Mr. Nadler proved swifter than any rabbit. Mr. Schiff was left spinning in Mr. Nadler\u2019s dust. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, reigning world champion in the five-yard microphone dash, marveled from the peanut gallery at Mr. Nadler\u2019s Olympic abilities.\n\nPerhaps, it was the waiting microphone before the empty chair in the House Judiciary Committee hearing room last week that saved Mr. Nadler\u2019s life. No mere automobile accident would keep him from holding court \u2014 especially when he himself is the court jester.\n\nAs it turned out, the automobile accident was so minor that the airbag did not deploy \u2014 until he got seated in the hearing room. And then the giant airbag EXPLODED.\n\n\u201cYou really can\u2019t hide behind legal fictions,\u201d Mr. Nadler raged at Mr. Barr, who had just explained that as a member of President Trump\u2019s Cabinet he was not at liberty to divulge privileged discussions with the president.\n\nThough Mr. Nadler attended law school, it is not clear if he was ever a terribly successful lawyer. Somewhere along the line, however, he got struck with just enough common sense to realize that the rioting in the streets that he and fellow Democrats refuse to condemn and Mr. Nadler is on record calling \u201ca myth\u201d does not look very good heading into an election.\n\nSo, Mr. Nadler sought to blame the riots on Mr. Barr and, by extension, on Mr. Trump. Yes, Mr. Nadler \u2014 AKA the exploded airbag \u2014 blames the riots on the only people who are lifting a finger to curb the riots and enforce, you know, the laws. You know, the ones arresting rioters for assaulting innocent people, firebombing public buildings, torching police cars, and using lasers to blind officers.\n\n\u201cThe president wants footage for his campaign and you appear to be serving it up to him as ordered,\u201d Mr. Nadler wheezed.\n\nYes, the looting and arson and bloodshed, the roping of statues in Washington, D.C., and Portland, Oregon, is all the fault of President Trump. And Bill Barr.\n\n\u201cShame on you, Mr. Barr! Shame on you!\u201d\n\nBy then, all the air had leaked out of the giant airbag and when Mr. Barr offered to answer the questions he had been called into the hearing for, the wheedling Nadler could only gasp, \u201cMy time has expired. My time has expired.\u201d\n\nThe whole hearing proved as enlightening as a clown car smash-up derby. Nobody was actually seeking answers. They just wanted to scream at Mr. Barr. And, whenever the attorney general offered to reply, they shouted, \u201cReclaiming my time!\u201d\n\nAs Mr. Barr noted, this is not normally how hearings go. Usually, the government official (in this case, Mr. Barr) is required to provide actual answers to actual questions posed by the committee.\n\nBut these are no more \u201chearings\u201d than the bloodthirsty arson and mayhem in the streets are \u201cprotests.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s all smash-and-grab politics and Jerold Nadler is the mythical airbag lording over all of it.\n\n\u2022 Charles Hurt is opinion editor of The Washington Times.

It had nothing to do with Joe Biden\u2019s inability to think clearly, just fairness.\n\nBut leave it to former Bill Clinton press secretary, Joe Lockhart, the dumbest person ever to hold that job to shatter the facade.\n\nIn a column last week, conspicuously titled, \u201cJoe Biden could still lose this election,\u201d Joe Lockhart spelled out his prescription directly to Biden.

On July 30, Belarus\u2019 Investigative Committee said the men will face criminal charges including \u201cpreparing mass disorder,\u201d an offense punishable by up to eight years in prison. Following the arrests, Belarus\u2019 KGB released a statement \u201cidentifying the men as part of the Wagner Group,\u201d a private military contractor believed to be controlled by an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Wagner Group is suspected of promoting the Kremlin\u2019s interests in Ukraine, Syria, and Libya, among other nations, though Russia officially denies using mercenaries.\n\nOn July 31, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed claims that \u201corganizations from Russia are sending some people to destabilize the situation in Belarus\u201d as \u201cnothing but insinuations.\u201d Peskov seemed to confirm the men\u2019s Russian nationality, denouncing the arrests as the \u201cgroundless detention of Russian citizens.\u201d He described the men as \u201cemployees of a private security company\u201d who were temporarily in Belarus on their way to Istanbul.\n\nOn Monday, Russian diplomat Kirill Pletnyev contradicted Peskov\u2019s claim that the men were en route to Istanbul. As reported by Reuters, Russian news agency RIA quoted Pletnyev as saying that \u201ctheir final destination was one of the states in the Latin American region.\u201d The diplomat did not elaborate on his claim. According to RIA, Belarus allowed Pletnyev \u201cconsular access\u201d to the detained Russians.\n\nRussia maintains close ties with some Latin American nations including socialist Venezuela. Last year, Moscow sent at least two Russian air force planes and roughly 100 Russian military personnel to Caracas, describing them as \u201cRussian specialists\u201d sent to service previously delivered military equipment.\n\nAccording to Alexander Agafonov, described by Reuters as \u201cthe head of the Belarusian investigative group \u2026 handling the case,\u201d the detained men have provided \u201ccontradictory accounts\u201d of their travel plans. On July 31, Agafonov was quoted as saying that \u201c11 of the arrested men had told authorities they planned to fly on to Venezuela, 15 to Turkey, two to Cuba, and one to Syria. Another said he did not know his destination, while three refused to make a statement.\u201d\n\nOn August 1, the head of Belarus\u2019 Investigative Committee, Ivan Noskevich, relayed this information to Belarus\u2019s dictator Alexander Lukashenko, who has demanded an official inquiry into the incident.\n\n\u201cThose who named Turkey as their destination cited a number of different reasons for going there,\u201d Noskevich told Lukashenko in a meeting broadcast on the state-run Belarus 1 TV channel. \u201cSome said they were planning to vacation, some said they were going to work as guards, and some said they planned to see Istanbul\u2019s iconic Hagia Sophia cathedral. While the group had purchased flight tickets to Istanbul, they never went to the airport.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was no [plan for] Istanbul and could not be,\u201d the president replied. \u201cIt is clear that this group had other goals.\u201d\n\nThe alleged Russian mercenaries could have been on their way to Sudan, the U.S. government-funded website Svoboda.org argued last week.

Moscow and Minsk are officially allies, but their relationship has grown increasingly strained in recent years. Observers have posited a variety of reasons for this state of affairs, including the Kremlin\u2019s designs to reunify Belarus with Russia as part of a supra-state, which Lukashenko has reportedly rebuffed. Others say that the two nations\u2019 failure to agree on a mutually beneficial oil supply contract for this year caused their relationship to rupture.\n\nBelarus has endured a highly contentious election season ahead of this weekend\u2019s August 9 presidential vote. Lukashenko has been \u201cpresident\u201d of Belarus since the office was established in 1994.

However, a source within the state-run Petroleum of Venezuela (PDSVA) confirmed to Reuters that the oil likely spilled from a ship\u2019s fuel tank and that the company would assist in the cleanup.\n\nAs well as the potentially devastating environmental impact of the oil itself, the incident represents the latest embarrassment to the Maduro regime as the country struggles with widespread gasoline shortages that are forcing people to wait hours or even days to fill up their vehicles.\n\nAs a result of the shortages, many Venezuelans have held fuel protests in recent months demanding an end to shortages. Despite having the largest oil reserves in the world after the United States, the country\u2019s economic and humanitarian crisis has led to a drastic decline in oil production. In June, overall production reportedly fell for the sixth month running, decreasing by a further 32 percent, forcing authorities to import reserves from allies such as Russia, China, and Iran.\n\nVenezuelans are now also required to provide biometric data when filling up, checked against the government\u2019s database using the \u201cFatherland Card,\u201d developed by communist China as a way of spying on citizens\u2019 behavior and spending habits. Although fuel prices are still relatively low (around $0.025 a liter), this is still extremely costly for the millions of people living on just a few dollars a month. The regime charges those who exceed the quota they set at $0.50 per liter, meaning only the wealthy can afford to buy a full gas tank.\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Parler, Facebook, or Twitter.

Naturally this has gone down like a cup of cold sick in the Conservatives\u2019 natural constituency, which largely comprises people over the age of 50. 24 hours after floating the idea in the newspapers the government started to backtrack. And understandably so.\n\nHere\u2019s a taste of the responses in the Conservatives\u2019 house journal, the Telegraph:\n\nThe ministry of silly ideas produces another one. They come up with more ludicrous nonsense each day, and we are paying their salaries! It\u2019s beyond a joke now. I\u2019ve had enough of this facade. It\u2019s so obviously a cover to bring in the great reset, give governments extraordinary powers that end democracy. I genuinely believe this one statement will cause the greatest backlash Johnson has initiated. From what I gather on Social Media his time will be less than Mays. Probably the end of the Tory Party as a whole.\n\nPerhaps the most significant response, though, is this one from columnist Sarah Vine:\n\nWe all have to die sooner or later. If I get Covid and cop it, so be it. My time has come. I'll have had a good life, better than most in this world at any rate. I certainly don't expect the entire nation to bankrupt itself to save my sorry ass. \u2014 Sarah Vine (@WestminsterWAG) August 2, 2020\n\nVine is, of course, married to one of the most senior ministers in Johnson\u2019s Cabinet, Michael Gove. Yes, Vine is famously independent and forthright and Gove has no control over her tweets. But her comment is, perhaps, indicative that all is not sweetness and harmony in the higher echelons of the Johnson administration. There is now a growing and very obvious rift over Johnson\u2019s Chinese coronavirus policy: between those dogged loyalists who think it is proportionate and responsible and those who think it is erratic, crazed, scientifically baseless, hysterical, and hugely damaging not just to the economy but to the wellbeing and sanity of the nation generally.\n\nMy sympathies are all with the latter camp. If \u2014 as is rumoured \u2014 Gove is planning to do a Kingslayer job on Boris, and do it properly this time unlike his previous botched attempt, then I wish him all the very best. Boris is really no longer fit to be Prime Minister, especially not when he\u2019s got a girlfriend as woke as Carrie Symonds whispering in his ear on issues like the extremist trans \u201crights\u201d agenda.\n\nThough Gove is wrong on a lot of issues \u2014 climate change being the most obvious one \u2014 he is absolutely correct to make coronavirus policy his line in the sand, his casus belli, the issue on which he is prepared to rupture party unity and, with luck, to oust the played out and discredited lame duck prime minister.\n\nSure, Britain has a heap of other troubles to contend with right now besides coronavirus. We saw one example of these at the weekend, with the demonstrations by race-baiting activists in paramilitary uniforms in South London: a menace an emasculated, politically correct police seem quite incapable of handling.\n\nThe Public Order Act 1936 prohibits by law paramilitary and political uniforms. Why is the Met Police allowing this to happen? pic.twitter.com/m63fnDQytS \u2014 Nigel Farage (@Nigel_Farage) August 2, 2020\n\nBut the British government\u2019s coronavirus malfeasance is by far the most dangerous and immediate threat to Britain, because its consequences are so far-reaching and potentially catastrophic in so many different ways.\n\nAt the moment, it\u2019s true, a significant chunk of the cowed, brainwashed, compliant population has bought into the government\u2019s Project Fear 3.0 scare narrative.\n\nBut the rebellion is growing as more and more evidence emerges that the coronavirus threat has been grossly overstated \u2014 for many people, symptoms are so mild they don\u2019t even know they\u2019ve got it; liberties are being seriously infringed to no obvious purpose.\n\nThe reason people are increasingly taking to the streets \u2014 as they did at yesterday\u2019s London protest march \u2014 and flouting government mask regulations is not that they are selfish, irresponsible, and careless of the lives of others. It\u2019s that they believe there is no conclusive scientific evidence masks are having an effect; the pandemic has long since peaked; the so-called \u201cspike\u201d in infections is a sign that more people are being tested, not that the disease is becoming more dangerous or easily transmissible; that pinning hopes on a rushed-out, insufficiently tested vaccine for a constantly mutating coronavirus is foolish; that the most sensible response is to protect the very vulnerable while allowing everyone else to develop herd immunity at minimal damage to the economy, as in Sweden.\n\nRather than address these compelling arguments, the Johnson administration has preferred to treat everyone like children to be cajoled, frightened, and bullied \u2014 but never reasoned or persuaded \u2014 into doing the government\u2019s bidding.\n\nThis is not a recipe for enduring popularity. Already, large cracks are appearing in the dam.\n\nGovernment adviser Professor Robert Dingwall \u2014 a member of the government\u2019s New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (NERVTAG) \u2014 has called for \u201ca sense of proportion\u201d.\n\nHe writes:\n\nCOVID-19 was linked to about 50,000 deaths in the first 16 weeks of the UK pandemic \u2013 but about 1,000 people normally die every week. In the past five weeks, fewer than usual have died. COVID-19 simply brought deaths forward by a few weeks or months \u2013 80 per cent of victims already had life-limiting medical conditions. Six months into this pandemic, we have learned that it will not wipe out human life on this planet. It is a nasty infection and every death represents a person loved by someone. But it is time for a sense of proportion.\n\nProfessor Carl Heneghan of Oxford has reiterated that coronavirus cases are NOT rising in England, that this is simply an artefact of increased testing.\n\nAnd government policy is, in any case, proving counterproductive. The otherwise baffling decision to make masks compulsory at a time when coronavirus deaths have dwindled almost to zero could, arguably, be explained in terms of persuading the nervous out of their hidey holes and into the outside world. In fact, though, shops are recording decreased footfall as a result. The bedwetters STILL aren\u2019t going out; the more intrepid, meanwhile, would rather shop online than shop while wearing muzzles.\n\nIn Game of Thrones, Jaime Lannister acquired the epithet Kingslayer because he killed the \u2018Mad King\u2019 Aerys Targaryen. Aerys\u2019s reign began well but descended into chaos as the king went mad, so the maligned Jaime in fact did the Seven Kingdoms a massive favour. It\u2019s not clear whether or not Boris Johnson has actually been deranged by a toxic combination of his near-fatal bout of coronavirus and having a Social Justice Warrior dolphin-hugger as his girlfriend \u2014 or whether he was always quite rubbish but just hid it well. What is clear is that the man has to go \u2014 and fast. He is steering Britain towards ruination.\n\nGove got an awful lot of stick when he last backstabbed Boris. But that was before we were all fully aware of just how useless Boris is. With hindsight, Gove was right all along. Let\u2019s hope that he does a better job of it next time round.", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/europe/2020/08/05/we-need-a-kingslayer-to-deal-with-the-mad-monarch-boris/", "published": "2020-08-05T00:00:00"}, {"title": "2,700 Evacuated as Fires Sweep French Region, Cause Unknown", "text": "PARIS (AP) \u2013 Fires fueled by strong Mediterranean winds have raced across multiple towns in the Marseilles region of France, leaving at least 22 people injured, destroying several businesses and forcing the evacuation of 2,700 tourists, nursing home residents and others.\n\nSome 1,800 firefighters, backed by planes and helicopters, battled the worst fires through the night around the town of Martigues.

The tension on those lines has resulted in street fights and escalated violence, including at the hands of Maduro soldiers.\n\nMaduro\u2019s attorney general announced last week that police had arrested four soldiers and two civilians for killing Carlos Chaparro, a 47-year-old Venezuelan who was protesting the gasoline shortages when he was killed. Venezuela has seen exponential growth in police brutality in the last decade, particularly under Maduro. Police in the country killed thousands, most of them unarmed protesters, during the peak of the anti-socialist movement in 2014-2016. The violence particularly affects minors. Children as young as 11 have reported extensive torture at the hands of police. Police have shot to death at least two 14-year-olds in the past five years.\n\nTeens also face violence when seeking to refuel. In mid-July, similar to Chaparro\u2019s case, assailants killed an 18-year-old during a scuffle at a line for gasoline rations. The Maduro regime has not yet identified the culprits.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2020/08/04/venezuela-man-arrested-filming-socialist-ambulance-running-out-gas/", "published": "2020-08-04T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Chinese Sociologist: Children of Communist Elite Choose to Leave", "text": "Zheng Yefu, the pen name of a retired sociologist and former professor at Peking University, wrote an article about the children of Chinese Communist Party (CCP) elite choosing to live overseas that has become a viral sensation on Chinese social media.\n\nZheng\u2019s article essentially argues that the children of China\u2019s rich and privileged political elite are embarrassingly unwilling to live under the rule of their authoritarian parents. Even more embarrassing is that most of them seem to prefer life in the United States.\n\nA longtime gadfly of the CCP, Zheng is one of the few prominent scholars who can get away with seriously criticizing the regime. His previous broadsides include advising the CCP to take lessons in good governance from Taiwan, hectoring top Chinese leaders to disclose all of their assets to prove they are not corrupt, and musing that the Chinese people would benefit greatly if the CCP agreed to \u201cpeacefully fade from history.\u201d\n\nZheng\u2019s latest bombshell predicts that the CCP might end up fading away because the next generation of Chinese leaders are heading West as fast as they can pack their bags.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t love the power, they love America,\u201d Zheng said of the children of top CCP leaders. This an especially shameful observation at a time when the CCP strives to portray the U.S. as a \u201crogue\u201d and \u201cbarbaric\u201d nation hell-bent on starting a new Cold War because its leaders are jealous of China\u2019s success and want to unfairly punish it by banning high-quality Chinese imports, including the odd high-quality coronavirus.\n\nZheng argued that China\u2019s leaders are hypocritical for using brute force to \u201cmaintain stability\u201d and \u201csafeguard the country created by the great Communist Party\u201d when their offspring do not want to live in the worker\u2019s paradise. He noted the younger generation of Chinese elites have more access to information from the outside world than the average citizen, and more freedom to travel there, so they are more keenly aware of how the CCP uses unsavory authoritarian techniques to maintain its power.\n\nVoice of America News (VOA) quoted readers of Zheng\u2019s work and said young Chinese elites are prudently choosing to live abroad because they do not want to be socially or physically destroyed when their families lose one of China\u2019s constant political battles.\n\n\u201cFor the second or third generation reds, if you lose in the power struggle, you are going to lose everything. Compare that to your opportunity to live a peaceful life in a free and democratic environment. So for some, they choose to stay away from the mess,\u201d explained human rights activist Hu Jia.\n\nVOA quoted several sources to convey a sense of how many Chinese elites have decided they would rather live in America:\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s only daughter, Xi Mingze, was educated at Harvard. Two of the party\u2019s last three top leaders, former President Zhao Ziyang and Jiang Zemin, had grandchildren who attended Harvard. Jia Qinglin, a former member of the Politburo Standing Committee, the party\u2019s highest ruling organ, had a granddaughter at Stanford. The now disgraced former Chongqing party star Bo Xilai, is the father of Bo Guagua, who had attended the Harvard Kennedy School of Government. The Washington Post reported that at least five of the nine members of the last Politburo Standing Committee have children or grandchildren who studied in the United States. The Washington-based Migration Policy Institute noted in a report that affluent and educated elites are the main force driving emigration from China to the U.S. According to a report from the China-based wealth research firm Hurun Research Institute, more than a third of rich Chinese \u201care currently considering\u201d emigrating to another country, for better education systems elsewhere and to flee the country\u2019s polluted cities and strict government, as well as protecting their wealth.\n\nAnother aspect of Chinese life that might be weighing heavily on the minds of elite children is the pronounced shift away from young leadership in favor of ancient, stodgy, politically-reliable administrators and Politburo members.\n\nXi Jinping effectively made himself dictator for life with constitutional revisions in 2018, and his regime has been distinctly uninterested in promoting new political talent or nourishing young leaders. Student protesters have been a constant thorn in Xi\u2019s side, from the pro-democracy youth of Hong Kong to the frustrated young Marxists of Chinese universities.\n\nEven the children of the most reliable Communist Party stalwarts must worry that it will be a long time before they have an opportunity to fulfill their own political ambitions.

Security concerns, however, were underscored on Sunday when the Education Ministry said it was taking a close look at university Mandarin programs linked to the Chinese government\u2019s official language training department, the Hanban, and China\u2019s network of Confucius Institute schools around the world.\n\nConfucius Institutes have come under close scrutiny in the United States and other countries for receiving heavy funding and political direction from the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Among other things, Confucius Institutes have been accused of coordinating CCP political activities in host countries, monitoring, and intimidating Chinese dissidents living abroad, influencing foreign universities, and facilitating the theft of intellectual property.\n\nThe Hindu noted that India presently has only two fully operational Confucius Institutes, at Mumbai University and the Vellore Institute of Technology, but the Education Ministry sent letters to at least five schools asking them to submit details of collaboration with Chinese government projects over the past three years.\n\nRepresentatives from several of those universities denied there was any Confucius Institute activity on their campuses. India\u2019s former ambassador to China, Ashok Kantha, told The Hindu that the Indian government has long made a distinction between the Confucius Institutes \u2014 \u201cwhich we had strong worries about\u201d \u2014 and programs that simply teach Chinese languages to Indian students.", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/asia/2020/08/03/india-reviews-university-language-programs-ties-chinese-government/", "published": "2020-08-03T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Cuban Democracy Groups Join Call to End Uyghur Slavery in China", "text": "The Assembly of the Cuban Resistance, a Miami-based human rights organization, recently joined the Coalition to End Forced Labour in the Uyghur Region, a group urging companies to stop profiting from the enslavement of Uyghurs in China.\n\nOrlando Guti\u00e9rrez-Boronat, the national secretary of the Assembly of the Cuban Resistance, told Breitbart News this weekend that the Assembly saw joining the global campaign for the rights of people on the other side of the world necessary because Cuba remains shackled by communism, as well, and \u201csolidarity is a commandment for the oppressed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe slave exploitation of workers by Communist regimes for the benefit of crony capitalism is something that we as Cubans face every day,\u201d Guti\u00e9rrez-Boronat noted.\n\nThe Castro regime has long enjoyed a friendship with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and is a formal member of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), China\u2019s plan to colonize the world\u2019s infrastructure, despite the fact that Cuba has no historical relationship with the Ancient Silk Road in Eurasia. China initially claimed the objective of the BRI was to reconstruct the Ancient Silk Road, leading to dubious claims that pre-Columbian America was connected to it.\n\nExperts believe the Chinese Communist Party has imprisoned between 1 and 3 million Uyghurs and other Muslim ethnic minorities in concentration camps in their native Xinjiang, China\u2019s westernmost province, which Uyghurs refer to as East Turkestan. Survivors of the camps say they experienced or witnessed extensive torture, rape, communist indoctrination, forced sterilization and abortion, infanticide, and forced labor. They also witnessed evidence that indicates China is harvesting the organs of concentration camp prisoners for sale on the black market. A study published this year revealed at least 83 global companies have made money from manufacturing in factories that exploit Uyghur slaves.\n\nCuba is also embroiled in its own slavery scandal \u2014 the use of thousands of medical professionals for unpaid labor in some of the most dangerous parts of the world. Cuba\u2019s \u201cmedical diplomacy\u201d consists of sending doctors to allied states in exchange for lucrative contracts totaling as much as $11 billion a year in profits for the Communist Party, but only a meager living \u201cstipend\u201d for the doctors. The health workers cannot opt out of the program once they leave the island and defectors are banned from returning to Cuba and seeing their families for at least eight years.\n\nThe Coalition to End Forced Labour in the Uyghur Region began as an already large list of over 130 organizations \u2014 largely labor groups, Uyghur human rights groups, and allies like Tibetan and Hong Kong democracy associations \u2014 making specific demands to the world\u2019s most lucrative and powerful companies to \u201cexit the Uyghur Region at every level of their supply chain, from cotton to finished products, to prevent the use of forced labour of Uyghurs and other groups in other facilities, and to end relationships with suppliers supporting the forced labour system.\u201d\n\nAt press time, the Coalition included over 200 organizations.\n\nThe Assembly of the Cuban Resistance is the only Hispanic democracy and human rights group on the list. There is one other Hispanic organization listed on the Coalition\u2019s website, the Mexican labor movement Red de Solidaridad de la Maquila, and a Brazilian workers\u2019 advocacy group, Central \u00danica dos Trabalhadores (as it was a Portuguese colony, Brazil is a Latin American but not Hispanic nation).\n\nOther notable groups of a wide variety of political ideologies include the American AFL-CIO union, the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation, Human Rights Watch, and the far-left European group HOPE Not Hate.\n\nGuti\u00e9rrez-Boronat called the Assembly of the Cuban Resistance\u2019s participation in the coalition a \u201cspecial distinction\u201d that highlights that human rights are a priority for all Hispanics, noting that the Assembly includes Venezuelan and Nicaraguan groups, as well. Among the groups represented in the Assembly is also the Association of Veterans of Bay of Pigs, the 2506 Brigade, who engaged in active hostilities against the Castro regime in 1961.\n\n\u201cWe are people from societies oppressed by a ruthless totalitarian regime and trying to regain our dignity, our rights, and freedoms. Communist China oppresses inside and outside its borders,\u201d Guti\u00e9rrez-Boronat noted. \u201cJust as the CCP dictatorship is allied with the Castro Regime, those who struggle for freedom and democracy must struggle together against the international structure of Communism.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Hispanic community should take the lead in denouncing CCP atrocities and repression, given the history of development of human rights doctrine and struggle for freedom that is an inherent part of Hispanic civilization,\u201d he concluded.\n\nCoalition members are asking that all global companies disentangle from the Chinese slave system within a year. In the group letter, they note the urgency of companies doing so comes from the sheer number of goods sourced and manufactured by slave labor. As China dominates most of the world\u2019s manufacturing, the fact that 84 percent of the cotton grown in China comes from Xinjiang means that about 20 percent of the world\u2019s cotton products can be traced back to the region. This means that around one in five clothing items were made in part with Uyghur or other Turkic Muslim slave labor.\n\nMultiple reports using satellite images of the camps have identified over 1,000 sites used to house Uyghur and other Muslim slaves in Xinjiang. In March, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) published a report revealing that China had begun busing Uyghur slaves out of Xinjiang to work in factories nationwide, meaning that global companies simply choosing not to operate in Xinjiang did not guarantee that their goods would not be made by slaves from the province.\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party claims the concentration camps are \u201cvocational training\u201d institutes where underprivileged minorities learn trades that can help them adapt to the modern Chinese economy.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/asia/2020/08/03/cuban-democracy-groups-join-call-end-uyghur-slavery-china/", "published": "2020-08-03T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Donald Trump Demands Portion of TikTok Sale for U.S. Treasury", "text": "President Donald Trump on Monday said that he supported the sale of TikTok to an American company but specified that the United States should get part of the funds.\n\n\u201cI said a very substantial portion of that price is going to have to come into the treasury of the United States because we\u2019re making it possible for this to happen,\u201d Trump said at the White House on Monday. \u201cRight now they don\u2019t have any rights unless we give it to them.\u201d\n\nThe president did not specify how much should be paid to the United States but said that it should be \u201ca lot of money.\u201d\n\nTrump spoke about the popular short video app owned by the Chinese company ByteDance after floating the idea of banning it outright.\n\n\u201cIt can\u2019t be controlled for security reasons by China, too big, too invasive, and it can\u2019t be,\u201d Trump said.

Fishing, tourism, and construction activities have been temporarily suspended.\n\nThe AP pointed out that this year\u2019s typhoon season has been \u201crelatively mild\u201d by historical standards, but the intense rainfall and flooding have inflicted over $7 billion in damage despite the modest size and number of named storms.\n\nWriting at the Maritime Executive on Sunday, Dr. Peter McCawley of Australian National University\u2019s Arndt-Corden Department of Economics saw the fresh barrels of rain headed for China as the next chapter in the \u201cmajor test\u201d faced by the massive Three Gorges Dam \u2013 the focus of much nervous attention from those living beneath it, and possibly the point of stress that could fracture the entire Chinese Communist regime if it fails:\n\nThe latest crisis within China is dangerous flooding along the Yangtze River, which is testing the design of the huge Three Gorges Dam. Completed in 2006, the dam is one of the world\u2019s largest megaprojects. The structure lies about 300 kilometres west of Wuhan, the metropolis of close to 20 million people where the novel coronavirus first broke out. The threats arising from the flooding have led to the evacuation of about 40 million people. Safety issues concerning the Three Gorges Dam reflect long-standing international debates about infrastructure, and especially dams, in developing countries. Large dam projects are almost always controversial.\n\nIn McCawley\u2019s analysis, the immense scale of the Three Gorges Dam makes it the biggest example of everything that can go wrong with such projects, from environmental disruption and population displacement to corruption and social costs.\n\nThe dam hopefully is not at risk of catastrophic structural failure, but its presence could be doing at least as much harm as good for flood control, particularly if the dam operators are obliged to continue venting huge amounts of floodwater into lower-lying regions with little warning. Also, the hydroelectric plant at Three Gorges supplies a great deal of electric power to meet China\u2019s growing needs, so there could be serious social, political, and economic consequences if the plant is forced to shut down or reduce capacity substantially.\n\n\u201cThe Three Gorges Dam has been a major showcase project for China. China\u2019s proud reputation as a global supplier of high-quality infrastructure is now at stake, as the reliability of the Three Gorges Dam is being put to the test,\u201d McCawley concluded.\n\nCNN noted on Friday that while the Chinese government still presents the Three Gorges Dam as an unmitigated triumph from every possible standpoint, \u201csome geologists say the limited role of the Three Gorges dam in flood control has been laid bare\u201d by the current crisis.\n\nSome areas downstream of Three Gorges are reporting the worst floods in modern history despite the presence of the gigantic dam, leading analysts to conclude the structure is mostly helpful for flood control during modest flood years but could be a net liability during severe seasons like the current one. The dam causes erosion of the surrounding hills, triggering landslides and worse flooding in tributaries of the Yangtze River, and the immense weight of its reservoir might even be causing more earthquakes in the region. Meanwhile, those displaced by the construction of the dam are still suffering the economic effects decades later, including reduced earning potential.\n\nAs one geologist put it: \u201cIt\u2019s like using a small cup to deal with a big tub of water. In terms of flood control, the cost of the dam has surely outweighed the gain.\u201d", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/08/03/typhoon-threatens-heavily-flooded-areas-of-china/", "published": "2020-08-03T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Russia: Thousands of Anti-Putin Protesters Turn Out for Fourth Week", "text": "Thousands of people braved challenging weather conditions in the far eastern part of Russia for the fourth week running this weekend to demonstrate against the increasing repression of Vladimir Putin\u2019s regime.\n\nAs torrential rain poured down, protesters took to the streets on Saturday in the city of Khabarovsk to protest against last month\u2019s arrest of Gov.

Authorities have not yet identified what the seeds are or how the senders chose their destinations. None of the recipients said they ordered seeds online or anything that could easily be mistaken for seeds. The Chinese Communist Party has denied any ties to the packages.\n\nAmerican agricultural officials have expressed concern that the seeds could be of invasive species that could cause significant environmental damage if planted in U.S. soil and warned anyone receiving the packages to immediately contact local authorities.\n\nIn the first similar statement from international officials, K. Keshavulu, a vice president of the ISTA, warned this weekend that those outside the United States should also exercise caution if receiving seed packages. As Keshavulu is also the head of the Telangana State Seed and Organic Certification Authority (TSSOCA) in India, mostly Indian media outlets carried his remarks.\n\n\u201cFollowing the unwanted/unsolicited delivery of such suspicious seed packets for the past one week, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has cautioned people, particularly those engaged in farming, against opening such suspicious seed packets, sowing them in farms or backyards or disposing in the garbage and urged them to give information to the officials,\u201d Keshavulu said in a statement Friday. The official speculated the seeds could be a part of either a \u201cbrushing scam and seed terrorism.\u201d\n\nA \u201cbrushing scam\u201d is a fraudulent way to boost the reputation of a product sold online. Those selling the product write a fake positive review for it under the name of someone who then receives a real, unsolicited package, but not necessarily containing the product reviewed. \u201cSince the name on the review belongs to someone who did receive the product, it\u2019s considered a verified purchase,\u201d Forbes explained.\n\n\u201cThese unsolicited seed packets may spread crop diseases and the poisonous seeds may damage the agriculture and allied sectors and also pose health and environmental problems,\u201d Keshavulu reportedly warned. \u201cIn the wake of unsolicited packages of seeds creating panic in some countries, people, farmers, seed agencies and associations, the agriculture department, farmers and other agencies should be on high alert. All of them should take precautionary measures.\u201d\n\nThe seeds could be carrying pestilent species or simply be members of an invasive species themselves which, when planted, take over the ground around them and kill off native fauna.\n\nWhile authorities have not documented any known cases of Indian recipients being targeted with unlabeled seeds, India is currently embroiled in an ongoing economic and diplomatic rivalry with China that erupted when Chinese troops illegally pitched tents on the Indian side of their mutual border in the Himalayas, triggering a bloody brawl believed to have killed up to 50 troops. The incident occurred in June and both sides have attempted to engage in diplomacy to prevent a repeat of the event since then, but New Delhi has responded by banning dozens of Chinese mobile applications from use in the country and embracing a grassroots \u201cboycott China\u201d movement.\n\nIndian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar told the Times of India in remarks published Sunday that both sides are attempting to find a peaceful resolution, but \u201creaching an equilibrium with China is not going to be easy and India must stand its ground.\u201d\n\nAmerican officials have expressed alarm at the Chinese mystery seeds.\n\n\u201cThis could be a very serious matter,\u201d Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller told Breitbart Texas. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what we don\u2019t know, and frankly, I am getting tired of surprises from China.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what they are, and we cannot risk any harm whatsoever to agricultural production in the United States,\u201d Kentucky Agriculture Commissioner Ryan Quarles said last week. \u201cWe have the safest, most abundant food supply in the world and we need to keep it that way.\u201d\n\n\u201c[We are] aware that people across the country have received unsolicited packages of seed from China in recent days,\u201d the USDA said in an official statement. \u201cAt this time, we don\u2019t have any evidence indicating this is something other than a \u2018brushing scam\u2019 where people receive unsolicited items from a seller who then posts false customer reviews to boost sales.\u201d\n\nTaiwanese officials issued similar warnings late last week after residents in the country began reporting similar seed parcel arrivals. China illegally claims Taiwan, officially the Republic of China, as a rogue province and regularly threatens to invade it.\n\nThe Chinese Foreign Ministry claimed that the postage labels on the packages identifying them as coming from China are counterfeit, denying their identified origin.\n\nThe packages began arriving as China lost large amounts of crops last month to historic floods, which are affecting 27 provinces and 24 million people. The loss of crops along the Yangtze River, one of the world\u2019s longest at nearly 4,000 miles, has boosted American agricultural sales.

The couple both worked at the National Children\u2019s Hospital\u2019s Research Institute in Columbus, Ohio, for a decade before being arrested in California in July 2019.

Some videos taken after the first small explosion show flashes that might plausibly be from commercial fireworks, or comparable small explosive charges, popping off. Most observers do not appear satisfied with fireworks as the cause of the second, far more powerful detonation:\n\nLooks like a fireworks depot was cohabitating with something a bit more sinister. https://t.co/pmXXksvi3u \u2014 David Reaboi (@davereaboi) August 4, 2020\n\nAl Jazeera News quoted the director-general of Lebanese public security stating the Beirut blast \u201cwas not a fireworks explosion, but a high-explosive material that was confiscated for years.\u201d\n\nIsraeli intelligence has long maintained that the Port of Beirut is a key element of the Iranian-Hezbollah project to assemble and deploy advanced missiles in Lebanon. The Israelis believe one of Iran\u2019s strategic goals is to establish domestic Lebanese production of guided missiles, thus reducing the cost and risk of shipping powerful weapons from Iran to its Hezbollah proxies.\n\nUpdate 2:15pm Eastern: Sky News quoted Lebanese officials who said \u201cat least ten people have been killed,\u201d with hundreds more injured by debris from the explosions. Lebanese media reported hospitals dealing with a huge number of casualties and calling for urgent blood donations.\n\n\u201cInjuries are definitely in the hundreds. I cannot give a specific number of casualties at the moment. We are overwhelmed with cases,\u201d a spokesman for the Lebanese Red Cross told NBC News.\n\nAl-Arabiya News from Saudi Arabia, whose government opposes Iran and Hezbollah, reported that the explosion \u201coccurred in a Hezbollah arms store in Beirut Port.\u201d\n\nUpdate 6:30pm Eastern: Casualty reports were updated throughout the day, with the New York Times counting at least 70 dead. Individual hospitals reported treating hundreds of injuries. The Red Cross estimated 2,500 injuries, declaring the incident a \u201chuge catastrophe.\u201d The Lebanese health ministry said there could be 4,000 wounded.\n\nAmong the dead identified so far was Nizar Najarian, the Lebanese Armenian secretary-general of the Christian political party Kateb.

The reddish-orange cloud hovering over the blast site was cited as evidence of a nitrate explosion.\n\nThe BBC quoted Lebanese President Michel Aoun calling it \u201cunacceptable\u201d that some 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate was stored in unsafe conditions at the port and forgotten. The cause of the initial explosion that evidently detonated the nitrate is still under investigation.\n\nAt a press conference on Tuesday afternoon, President Donald Trump said the explosion \u201clooks like a deadly attack\u201d and said the United States \u201cstands ready to assist Lebanon.\u201d\n\nAn unnamed Israeli government official told the Washington Post that Israel had \u201cno connection with the incident in Beirut, despite recent tensions with the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah on its northern border.\u201d According to a statement quoted by the BBC, the Israeli government has \u201capproached Lebanon through international security and diplomatic channels and has offered the Lebanese government medical and humanitarian assistance.\u201d\n\nThe Post also reported that Beirut governor Marwan Abboud said contact has been lost with a number of firefighters who responded to the scene.", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/08/04/massive-explosion-rocks-port-district-of-beirut-lebanon/", "published": "2020-08-04T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Oprah Hosts White Guilt Session: \u2018Whiteness Gives You an Advantage No Matter What\u2019", "text": "Billionaire media mogul Oprah Winfrey declared in an episode of her eponymous series, The Oprah Conversation that \u201cwhiteness\u201d and \u201cwhite privilege\u201d afford unspecified benefits to white people in the \u201ccaste system\u201d of America.\n\nIn an episode entitled \u201cUncomfortable Conversations with a Black Man: Part 1\u201d \u2014 featuring former NFL linebacker Emmanuel Acho and drawing its name from Acho\u2019s YouTube series of the same name \u2014 Oprah Winfrey invited several white people to discuss \u201cracism,\u201d \u201cwhite privilege,\u201d and \u201cwhiteness.\u201d Oprah praised her white guests for accusing themselves of being \u201cracist.\u201d\n\nOprah said:\n\nThere are white people who are not as powerful as the system of white people \u2014 the caste system that\u2019s been put in place \u2014 but they still, no matter where they are on the rung, or the ladder of success, they still have their whiteness. \u2026 [Whites have a] leg up.

Even the perception that our commitment to serving the men and women of this nation is applied unevenly is destructive,\u201d Rear Admiral Collin Green, who heads the Naval Special Warfare Command, said in an email to his forces on Monday evening.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe will revisit our relationship with the Museum when I am convinced that they have made the necessary changes to ensure this type of behavior does not happen again.\u201d\n\nIn the letter, Green said, \u201cWhile the museum is an independent non-profit organization and the participants were contracted employees from outside the DoD, in many ways, these facts are irrelevant.

Museum officials did not respond to repeated requests for comment from the AP.\n\nThe letter comes one day after a pair of videos of an event at the Fort Pierce, Florida-based museum last year surfaced Sunday on social media.

Others found no issue with the video due to their disagreement with Kaepernick\u2019s protests during the national anthem which they believe are unpatriotic and disrespectful to the memory of fallen service members, a viewpoint shared by President Donald Trump.\n\nKaepernick, 32, began his protests in 2016 and began to kneel during the national anthem after Nate Boyer, a former Army special forces soldier who tried out as a long snapper for the Seattle Seahawks, suggested it. The former San Francisco quarterback and other players faced intense backlash. But a number of athletes have started kneeling after national protests broke out in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s death at the hands of police in Minneapolis in May.\n\nThe video comes to light during a volatile time for Naval Special Warfare Command as it continues to grapple with breakdowns in discipline among their rank-and-file.

That event also prompted Walker to think about the pro sports leagues that have embraced BLM.\n\n\u201cFor the first time in a long time I stopped in the middle of my workout because last night I saw something that really, really disturbed me,\u201d Walker explained. \u201cI saw a bunch of people holding a BLM sign burning the Holy Bible. Burning the flag of the United States of America, also burning a cross. And I started thinking that NFL, NBA, WNBA, MLB: is this the people you\u2019re supporting right now? Is it the movement? Is it the organization? Because I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right.\u201d\n\nWalker added, \u201cMaybe, Washington: we cannot continue to sweep stuff underneath the rug, \u2019cause sooner or later we\u2019re gonna stumble.

But its 3.4 million average fell short of Hannity (4.3M), Carlson (4M), and Maddow (3.6); all three drew close to normal viewership. (The Five, as non-head-to-head airing, too topped MLB with 3.6M viewers.)\u201d\n\nGetting their lunch stolen by The Five, has to be especially displeasing to MLB. Not because The Five isn\u2019t a great show. Though, it airs at 5 PM EST, an especially challenging time slot with lots of local TV competition and likely viewers in transit from work to home.\n\nThings did not improve for the sports leagues a week later when the NBA made its return, it only got worse.\n\n\u201cLast Thursday, the NBA\u2019s highly-discussed return also didn\u2019t bother primetime news,\u201d Outkick reports. \u201cThe NBA\u2019s restart \u2014 two games \u2014 opened to 2.75 million viewers. It lost to several cable news shows that aired directly against it: Tucker Carlson Tonight, 4 million; Hannity, 3.8 million; the Ingraham Angle; 3 million, Rachel Maddow Show, 3 million. (Earlier in the day, The Five, at 3.2 million, outperformed the NBA.)\u201d\n\nCNBC reports the NBA average viewership on opening night to be 2.9 million. However, whether 2.75 or 2.9, the NBA not only bent the knee for the anthem, they also bent the knee to Rachel Maddow.\n\nMany in the sports media assumed that sports fans have been starving for their sports. However, on opening night, the ratings show that cable news has more fans than either pro baseball or basketball. Indeed, Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson seem to have more fans than both leagues combined.\n\nBaseball debuted with nearly all players and coaches kneeling in protest during the national anthem. In addition, MLB stenciled Black Lives Matter on pitcher\u2019s mounds at every stadium during opening week.\n\nAs to the NBA, players have hit the boards wearing Black Lives Matter shirts, kneeling during the anthem, and having Black Lives Matter emblazoned on the court directly above the NBA logo.\n\nThe NBA and MLB showed the world during their opening games that they\u2019re more concerned with politics than sports.

The 2019 incident regarding Morey is a huge shot to Kerr\u2019s credibility as an advocate for human rights.\n\nIn October of last year, Morey took to Twitter to post a statement that should have been utterly uncontroversial for anyone interested in freedom, liberty, and human rights. He posted a simple phrase: \u201cFight for Freedom, stand with Hong Kong.\u201d The tweet was meant to highlight the fight for democracy being waged by the once-free Hong Kong people who are losing freedoms daily since China took active possession of the region from the British.\n\nMorey\u2019s tweet kicked up a firestorm as China reacted in horror that someone would dare criticize its oppression of the people of Hong Kong. But instead of rallying to Morey\u2019s support for freedom \u2014 not to mention his American right to free speech \u2014 the league came down on Morey like a ton of bricks, forcing him to delete the tweet and grovel in apology at China\u2019s feet.\n\nDespite Morey\u2019s and the NBA\u2019s supplication, China tempestuously cut ties with the league \u2014 but only for a time \u2014 as punishment for Morey\u2019s support of democracy in Hong Kong.\n\nThroughout last year\u2019s controversy, Kerr, who is always quick to attack America, remained quiet and refused to stand up for democracy and for Morey\u2019s right to free speech. But now, even as he continues to decline to support freedom in Hong Kong, Kerr says he regrets at least not standing up for Morey\u2019s right to free speech.\n\nIn an interview with Washington Post, Kerr now says he should have spoken out against the attacks Morey suffered.\n\nShowing that he is still entirely unbothered by Chinese oppression, Kerr told Buckner that he should have listened to his \u201cgut\u201d better.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve learned of the last four years since I\u2019ve been\u2026 [outspoken] the questions aren\u2019t always easy. If you follow your gut and your heart, you generally just speak your truth, and you\u2019re going to feel good about it afterwards.

He discussed not only reconciliation with teammates, but also how he has adapted to restrictions brought on by the coronavirus pandemic, new offseason training techniques aimed at improving long passes and even breaking his renowned finger-licking habit.\n\n\u201cBelieve it or not, I\u2019m telling you I have not licked my fingers in four months,\u201d Brees said as he started to laugh.\n\n\u201cIf I can break myself of the licking-the-fingers habit, then I think that means anybody can break themselves of any habit, because that was out of control,\u201d he added, noting that he wouldn\u2019t just do it while throwing a football but also while turning pages in a book, or any activity that might be more efficient with tacky finger tips.\n\nBut before he even took a question, Brees opened the conference call with a statement about his introspection since early June, when he became seen by many as a symbol of white privilege for saying he would never approve of anyone disrespecting the flag by kneeling during the anthem. Those comments came while protests were proliferating across the country in response to a white Minneapolis police officer\u2019s video-recorded killing of George Floyd.\n\nBrees faced a scathing backlash from several current and former Black teammates and other high-profile athletes such as LeBron James.\n\nBut the quarterback apologized soon afterward and said he realizes now that protesting by kneeling during the anthem, initiated by former San Francisco QB Colin Kaepernick in 2016, was never about the flag.\n\n\u201cTo think for a second that New Orleans or the state of Louisiana, or the Black community would think I was not standing with them for social justice, that completely broke my heart. It was crushing. Never, ever would I feel that way,\u201d Brees said Saturday in his opening statement.\n\n\u201cI recognize that I missed an opportunity that day. I had an opportunity to talk about and emphasize the social injustices that exist for our Black community and our need as country to support them and advocate for systemic change. And my lack of awareness in that moment hurt a lot of people.\u201d\n\nBrees added that he has had many conversations with teammates since then and particularly in recent days and that they have \u201creconciled and put closure on anything from the past, and we are moving forward to focusing on the issues of social justice.\u201d\n\nBrees singled out safety Malcolm Jenkins, who had been among his harshest critics, saying, \u201cI am a friend of Malcolm. I am his teammate and I am his ally. There are many things that we\u2019re having a conversation about working on together. All of our goals are aligned.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Brees emphasized that he is \u201cthe same person now that I have always been. \u2026 I\u2019m someone who feels a great sense of responsibility to serve and to lead and to bring true equality to everyone.\u201d\n\nTurning to football, Brees said the pandemic is forcing him to consider new ways of practicing leadership and promoting team chemistry.\n\nHe cited wearing monitors at team headquarters that flash red and beep when one is standing within six feet of another person as an example of how face-to-face contact has been affected.\n\nGone are the days, Brees noted, when \u201cyou\u2019re all in that locker room and it\u2019s super-tight, and you\u2019re at the hotel and it\u2019s super tight, and you\u2019re having those moments to really develop the camaraderie.\u201d\n\nBrees said he was able to travel to Denver for a few days to train with new receiver Emmanuel Sanders, but otherwise did much of his training in the backyard of his offseason home in the San Diego area. That\u2019s where he worked with throwing mechanics guru Tom House on improving passes of about 60 yards.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve applied a lot of different techniques and a lot of training methods,\u201d Brees said. \u201cThere\u2019s been some moments of discovery.\u201d\n\nBrees declined to say whether he views this season as his last, but he said he put a lot of thought into his decision to play this season, coming to the conclusion that he wanted to remain a part of a team he loves, which also happens to see itself as a Super Bowl favorite.\n\n\u201cFair or not, I think we all agree that quarterbacks and head coaches in large part are evaluated on wins, losses, championships,\u201d Brees said. \u201cI came back for my team and I came back to chase that\u201d championship.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to enjoy every second of this journey and just value every moment.\u201d", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/sports/2020/08/02/brees-will-stand-for-anthem-but-respects-those-who-kneel/", "published": "2020-08-02T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Report: Group of Pac-12 Players Threatens to Boycott Season over Virus, Social Justice Concerns", "text": "While professional football, baseball, and basketball players have been opting out of their upcoming seasons by the dozens, less has been heard from the nation\u2019s collegiate athletes.\n\nWell, that\u2019s beginning to change.\n\nAccording to a report obtained by ESPN, a group of players from several different Pac-12 schools have threatened to sit out preseason and regular season games unless the Pac-12 makes certain concessions.

We have achieved striking success in the sports we love, and we are committed to preserving the same equality of opportunity for future female athletes. We strongly believe that everyone should have the opportunity to compete, but true athletic parity for women demands that women\u2019s sports be protected for biological females. Protecting the integrity of women\u2019s sports has, for decades, played an integral role in remedying past discrimination against women and empowering them to achieve their full athletic potential.\n\nThe letter cited examples about how transgender athletes have displaced top women athletes, including Allyson Felix, a Team USA sprinter who holds the most World Championship medals in history. In 2018, 276 high school boys ran faster times in the 400-meter contest on 783 occasions \u2014 showing the striking difference between biological females and biological male performances.\n\nThe letter added that transgender females who undergo testosterone hormone suppression does not level the playing field. The letter said:\n\nWe do not want to watch our athletic achievements be erased from the history books by individuals with all the inherent athletic advantages that come from a male body.

What\u2019s more, he hoped the protests made Colin Kaepernick proud.\n\nSpeaking to reporters after the Lakers victory over the Clippers, James tried to encapsulate what the night meant for him.\n\n\u201cI hope we made Kaep proud. I hope we continue to make Kaep proud every single day. I hope I make him proud with how I live my life, not only on the basketball floor but off the floor,\u201d James said of the NFL\u2019s original anthem protester. \u201cI\u2019ve been one to always speak out about things that I feel like is unjust. If I\u2019m educated on things, I always go about it that way. So Kaep was someone who stood up when times weren\u2019t comfortable, and people didn\u2019t understand or refused to listen to what he was saying.\u201d\n\nJames continued, \u201cYou go back and look at any of his postgame interviews when he talked about why he was kneeling, it had absolutely nothing to do about the flag, had absolutely nothing to do about the soldiers, the men and women that keep our land free. He explained that and the ears were uncomfortable. People never listened. They refused to listen. And I did. And a lot of my people in the Black community did listen. And we just thank him for sacrificing everything that he did to put us in a [situation where] today, even years later, to be able to have that moment like we did tonight.\u201d\n\nThis is a lie, and if there was a shred of integrity left in the American media they would go back to Colin Kaepernick\u2019s postgame interview and easily prove James to be a liar.\n\nColin Kaepernick never said his anthem protests weren\u2019t about the flag. In fact, he said the exact opposite. In 2016, after he sat for the national anthem prior to a preseason game against the Packers, Kaepernick made it plain that his protest absolutely was aimed at the country and the symbols that represent it.\n\n\u201cI am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,\u201d Kaepernick told NFL Media. \u201cTo me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.\u201d\n\nThere is no other way to interpret that. Though, while seeking to make the protests politically palatable to the masses, activists athletes and media were successful in making most people forget about Kaepernick\u2019s words.\n\nThen, as if any other proof was needed that Kaepernick despises his country and its flag, there was his Independence Day tweet from this year.\n\nAccording to Kaepernick, America has \u201cdehumanized, brutalized, criminalized + terrorized\u201d blacks for centuries. He further called the celebrations commemorating the nation\u2019s founding a \u201ccelebration of white supremacy.\u201d\n\nBlack ppl have been dehumanized, brutalized, criminalized + terrorized by America for centuries, & are expected to join your commemoration of \u201cindependence\u201d, while you enslaved our ancestors.

The debate commission has invited both candidates to participate in three debates. Joe Biden has accepted. Donald Trump has not. Mystery solved,\u201d he added.\n\nErin Perrine, Director of Press Communications for the Trump Campaign, affirmed on Tuesday that the Trump campaign has, indeed, formally committed to the debate commission for the three scheduled debates in the fall.\n\nDespite the Biden team\u2019s view, it was just days ago that Bill Clinton Press Secretary Joe Lockhart appeared on CNN, pressing Biden to refuse to debate the president. Days earlier, he published a piece, which ran on CNN, listing six things Biden must do now until the election in order to help win. Avoiding debates with the president made his list.\n\nHe wrote:\n\nWhatever you do, don\u2019t debate Trump. Trump has now made more than 20,000 misleading or false statements according to the Washington Post. It\u2019s a fool\u2019s errand to enter the ring with someone who can\u2019t follow the rules or the truth. Biden will undoubtedly take heat from Republicans and the media for skipping the debates. But it\u2019s worth the risk as trying to debate someone incapable of telling the truth is an impossible contest to win.\n\nSimilarly, the New York Times recently ran an op-ed titled \u201cLet\u2019s Scrap the Presidential Debates,\u201d which argued that debates are irrelevant.\n\nJournalist Elizabeth Drew wrote in part:\n\nThe debates have never made sense as a test for presidential leadership. In fact, one could argue that they reward precisely the opposite of what we want in a president. When we were serious about the presidency, we wanted intelligence, thoughtfulness, knowledge, empathy and, to be sure, likability. It should also go without saying, dignity. Yet the debates play an outsize role in campaigns and weigh more heavily on the verdict than their true value deserves.\n\nThere are several more examples, as Breitbart News\u2019s John Nolte demonstrated:\n\nA number of Democrats, including Bill Kristol, are urging that the debates be canceled. A former senior adviser to Hillary Clinton agrees: \u201cBiden shouldn\u2019t feel obligated to throw Trump a lifeline by granting him any debates at all. This is not a normal presidential election and Trump is not a legitimate candidate,\u201d Zac Petkanas tweeted last week. And then there\u2019s Thomas Friedman, an anti-Trump New York Times columnist, who urged Biden just last week not to debate the president unless Trump agrees to \u201ctwo conditions.\u201d Of course those conditions are ridiculous \u2014 Trump must release his tax returns and agree to \u201creal-time fact checking\u201d during the debate \u2014 and will never be agreed to, and therefore ensure there will be no debates.\n\nNonetheless, establishment media figures are toeing the party narrative alongside the Biden campaign, contending that the push to cancel debates is nothing more than a brainchild of the GOP and Trump allies alike.\n\nThe Washington Post\u2019s Dave Weigel referred to the \u201c\u2019Biden wants to cancel the debates\u2019 meme\u201d as a \u201cTV invention,\u201d and CNN\u2019s own Brian Stelter referred to the subject as \u201cmostly a right-wing media tempest, fueled by hour after hour of Fox commentary (not reporting), far removed from campaign reality,\u201d despite his own network serving as a platform for progressive advocates of the proposal.\n\nThe three presidential debates are currently scheduled for Tuesday, Sept. 29; Thursday, Oct. 15; and Thursday, Oct. 22.", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/08/04/joe-biden-team-trump-allies-touting-imaginary-controversy-about-biden-dodging-debates/", "published": "2020-08-04T00:00:00"}, {"title": "WATCH: Ken Cuccinelli Describes Rioters Disguising Themselves as \u2018Press\u2019", "text": "Acting Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security Ken Cuccinelli told the Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s Subcommittee on the Constitution on Tuesday violent that rioters in Portland were disguising themselves as members of the press.\n\nLast month, U.S. Judge Michael H. Simon \u2014 a Barack Obama appointee \u2014 issued a temporary restraining order (TRO) barring federal law enforcement using force against, dispersing, or threatening journalists during riots in Portland.\n\nSince then, there have been reports of rioters who have dressed in black and marked themselves as \u201cpress\u201d to avoid being targeted by police \u2014 and, reportedly, to carry out violent attacks against federal law enforcement officers with impunity.\n\nPPB has seen a number of people purporting to be \u201cmedia\u201d or \u201cpress\u201d who are not in recent weeks. This is concerning and takes away from legitimate media efforts. https://t.co/mAfxHwyASj \u2014 Portland Police (@PortlandPolice) July 26, 2020\n\nThe Portland Police Department reported last weekend \u2014 after the withdrawal of federal law enforcement personnel \u2014 that rioters \u201cwith \u2018press\u2019 written on their outer garments repeatedly threw objects at officers.\u201d\n\nCuccinelli noted the TRO had been extended to all federal law enforcement agencies.\n\n\u201cBut upon the implementation of that order \u2026 suddenly, people started sprouting, wearing, all black bloc, and \u2018press\u2019,\u201d he told the Senate.\n\nThe Department of Justice (DOJ) asked the federal court last week to rescind the TRO, noting that rioters had been exploiting the TRO to carry out violence while disguised as journalists \u2014 or, in some cases, apparently while working as journalists.\n\n\u201c[F]ederal officers have identified (1) individuals pretending to be press or legal observers, and, relatedly, (2) individuals presenting indicia of press affiliation under the TRO who have engaged in unlawful actions,\u201d the DOJ filing stated.\n\nIt presented several examples (citations omitted):\n\nFor example, a protester carrying a shield that identified him as press was taken into custody for impeding federal officers who were attempting to control the crowd, and was found to be in possession of a gun. Another individual who self-identified as a reporter unlawfully entered federal property and, after refusing to leave, resisted arrest. A third individual wearing indicia of press membership and self-reporting as press, was arrested for failing to comply with lawful direction of a federal officer, and discovered to be carrying commercial grade fireworks, which, throughout the protests, have been used as a tactic to harass federal officers, and which are illegal in Oregon. On July 28, 2020, an officer observed an individual wearing a helmet bearing the word \u201cPRESS\u201d and using a power tool to attempt to breach the fence around the Courthouse. In the early morning on July 29, 2020, an individual wearing \u201cpress\u201d identification on his helmet breached the security barrier around the courthouse by jumping over the perimeter fence. Most recently, on the night of July 29, 2020, an individual wearing \u201cpress\u201d identification assisted another protester to breach the perimeter fence. Attempting to comply with the TRO more generally has also impeded federal officers in their duties and endangered the safety of both officers and purported members of the press. Individuals identifying as members of the press have repeatedly placed themselves between federal officers and protesters posing an imminent threat. Such individuals are also often in the middle of crowds of violent protesters, not physically separated, impeding dispersal and endangering officers who must attempt to determine if individuals refusing lawful orders are covered by the TRO. Indeed, officers have been assaulted by some of these individuals while attempting to determine if they are in fact journalists, impeding the officers\u2019 ability to accomplish their duties and putting them in danger. Finally, under the chaotic circumstances of the protests, it is difficult for officers, who are often wearing gas masks and laser protective goggles, to verify small indicia of press membership that may be present on certain members of crowds. It is particularly difficult for officers to make these determinations while remaining a safe distance away from crowds to employ crowd control devices in a manner that is safe for both the crowd and the officers.\n\nCuccinelli noted that these tactics had spread beyond Portland, and had been filmed in Seattle.\n\nThere, he said, people disguising themselves as members of the media had been standing between police and rioters. \u201cThey\u2019re actively performing a shield function.\u201d\n\nDemocrats on the Senate subcommittee complained that federal officers were suppressing the right to free speech and assembly.\n\nJoel B.

If Joe Biden is now going to be the 46th president of the United States, you will have him being inaugurated and watching police and armed forces trying to pull Donald Trump out of the White House. I cannot wait for that split-screen,\u201d Ryan said.\n\nRyan said this during a Sunday appearance on CNNLOL\u2019s Newsroom with Ana Cabrera after being asked about Trump\u2019s tweet last week about postponing the November presidential election.\n\nRyan identifies as an objective reporter.\n\nIn her word salad response, Ryan also made the bizarre comparison between Trump and, uhm, Malcolm X.\n\n\u201cThis president is imploring and channeling a pre-Mecca Malcolm X, with the words \u2018by any means necessary.'\u201d\n\nWhatever that means.\n\nFor balance, CNNLOL\u2019s other guest was Joe Biden supporter Bill Kristol \u2014 the \u201cbalance\u201d of course being two Trump haters balanced on the right side of the screen.\n\nApril Ryan, of course, is one of CNNLOL\u2019s more entertaining hypocrites.\n\nIf you recall, she\u2019s the \u201cjournalist\u201d who regularly and falsely accused Trump of putting journalists at risk and then had a bodyguard who roughed up a left-leaning journalist for the sin of reporting on one Madame Ryan\u2019s public appearances.\n\nThis is also the same April Ryan who spread a conspiracy theory about Trump planning to nuke the continent of Africa, who barred former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee from entering Heaven, and who suggested Trump\u2019s former press secretary, Sarah Sanders, should be decapitated. She\u2019s also a stone-cold liar.\n\nRyan serially-embarrassing herself is not entirely her fault. She\u2019s a fanatic, but also a stupid one who doesn\u2019t know she\u2019s stupid, who doesn\u2019t know she makes a fool of herself, and this is something CNNLOL eagerly exploits for clicks and viral opportunities. Like the just-as-dumb Chris Cuomo, she\u2019s one of CNNLOL\u2019s circus geeks, a freak attraction, a constant car-wreck of idiocy and left-wing extremism that serves CNNLOL\u2019s political goals of normalizing political violence and partisan conspiracy theories.\n\nShe certainly does nothing for CNN\u2019s ratings or ad revenue, which continue to land in last place.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget that this entire conspiracy theory about Trump refusing to leave office if he loses in 2020 is a total media invention. If Trump believes the 2020 election was rigged, which is a very good possibility with mail-in-voting \u2014 something created by Democrats to make cheating easier (and something entirely different from absentee ballots), he has every right to contest the election, just as then-Vice President Al Gore did when he lost to George W. Bush in 2000.\n\nThere are all kinds of legal methods for Trump to contest the election, and prior to Inauguration Day, those legal methods will be exhausted. Trump will either win or lose in court, and if he loses of course he will leave the White House, just as Gore did in 2000.\n\nBut America\u2019s media freaks gotta make a living.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

However, the mainstream media \u2014 as usual \u2014 seemed determined to cover up the violence.\n\nEven the nominally conservative Wall Street Journal played the game.\n\nThe Journal reported on Sunday afternoon: \u201cWith No Federal Agents on Streets, Portland Protests Turn Largely Peaceful.\u201d Six paragraphs into the article, however, it noted:\n\nSeparately, a few hundred protesters descended on a police precinct on the city\u2019s east side, according to local law enforcement, where they shined lasers at officers and threw glass bottles at them. The Portland Police Bureau said on Twitter that the gathering had been declared an unlawful assembly and that two people had been arrested.\n\nIn claiming that the protests had become more peaceful because of the absence of federal officers, the Journal cited \u201cprotesters\u201d \u2014 the people with an interest in sending the message that federal officers were to blame for the violence.\n\nThe Journal has earned a conservative reputation due to the opinions on its editorial page.

It concerns a certain (as he would be listed on Louisiana ballots) William \u201cBill\u201d Clinton. The story involves Clinton palling around with the very shady (and very rich) Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein, a convicted pedophile who would later donate somewhere between $1 million and $5 million to the Clinton Presidential Library, reportedly flew with Clinton and a couple of babes to visit the Sultan of Brunei back in 2002.\n\nNumerous other news clips about Epstein and Clinton were also circulated among campaign staff, the emails show.\n\nOne email titled \u201c2016 GOP HIT on HRC\u201d was widely circulated among Clinton\u2019s campaign staff and DNC officials. The missive contained the text of a Fox News article titled, \u201cFlight logs show Bill Clinton flew on sex offender\u2019s jet much more than previously known.\u201d\n\nNumerous emails from various campaign and DNC staff were tweets from high profile Republicans promoting the Fox News article, including tweets on the Epstein and Clinton story sent out by Trump spokesman Sean Spicer, as well as Republican National Committee staffer and future White House spokesperson Raj Shah.\n\nHillary\u2019s campaign staff was well justified in their concerns over the publication of any associations between Epstein and Bill Clinton, as the two had long maintained ties, with Epstein being a prominent donor to both of Clinton\u2019s White House bids.\n\nOn Thursday, a 2011 deposition given by Virginia Roberts Giuffre, one of Epstein\u2019s most high-profile victims, was unsealed by a federal court judge.\n\nIn it, Giuffre claims that Clinton was a guest at Epstein\u2019s private estate in the U.S. Virgin Islands shortly after leaving the White House. Giuffre, who was 17-years-old at the time of the alleged visit, claims that Clinton stayed at the estate with \u201ctwo young girls\u201d from New York.\n\n\u201cI remember asking Jeffrey what\u2019s Bill Clinton doing here kind of thing, and he laughed it off and said, \u2018Well he owes me a favor,\u2019\u201d Giuffre told lawyers.\n\n\u201cHe never told me what favors they were,\u201d she added. \u201cI never knew. I didn\u2019t know if he was serious. It was just a joke\u2026 He told me a long time ago that everyone owes him favors. They\u2019re all in each other\u2019s pockets.\u201d\n\nClinton\u2019s appearance stood out, according to Giuffre, since Epstein\u2019s Caribbean estate was known as a locale where \u201corgies were a constant thing that took place.\u201d\n\nIn a statement to Newsweek on Friday, Angel Ure\u00f1a, a spokesperson for Clinton, denied the allegation, saying Clinton has \u201cnever been to Little St. James Island,\u201d a claim that had previously been made by the Clinton representatives in 2019.\n\nIn July 2019, the controversial financier pleaded not guilty to sex-trafficking charges in Manhattan federal court. In the case, Epstein allegedly \u201csexually exploited and abused dozens of minor girls at his homes\u201d in New York, Palm Beach, and other locations. The indictment also charged that Epstein paid some of his alleged victims to recruit more underage girls. Epstein was denied bail in the case and on August 10th was found dead in his federal jail cell at Manhattan\u2019s Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC).\n\nFollowing Epstein\u2019s indictment, Ure\u00f1a tweeted a similar denial that said, \u201cPresident Clinton knows nothing about the terrible crimes Jeffrey Epstein pleaded guilty to in Florida some years ago, or those with which he has been recently charged in New York.\u201d\n\nBreitbart News previously listed six major issues with Clinton\u2019s full statement on Epstein in 2019, which has taken on new relevance with Clinton doubling down on his claim.\n\n1 \u2013 Clinton\u2019s statement claimed a \u201ctotal of four trips\u201d on Epstein\u2019s private jet, amid widespread reports of many more trips.\n\nOne portion of Clinton\u2019s statement, via his spokesperson, reads:\n\nIn 2002 and 2003, President Clinton took a total of four trips on Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s airplane: one to Europe, one to Asia, and two to Africa, which included stops in connection with the work of the Clinton Foundation.\n\nThe statement failed to mention documentation reportedly evidencing many more trips with Epstein on the financier\u2019s airplane.\n\nFox News previously reported flight records from 2001 to 2003 that show Clinton took at least 26 trips aboard Epstein\u2019s jet, dubbed the \u201cLolita Express.\u201d\n\nNewsweek reported on a Gawker story that exposed flight logs showing numerous private airplane trips that Clinton allegedly took with Epstein. One flight reportedly included a softcore porn actress while other trips were allegedly shared with women listed on flight manifests without their full names.\n\nThe Newsweek report stated:\n\nIn 2015, Gawker released the flight logbooks for Epstein\u2019s Gulfstream and the Lolita Express 727. Bill Clinton is among the prominent people listed in the flight logs, having taken several trips on the Lolita Express with a softcore porn actress listed under \u201cmassages\u201d in Epstein\u2019s address book, also published by Gawker. Clinton shared eleven flights aboard the Lolita Express with Maxwell and Epstein\u2019s former assistant, Sarah Kellen, who has been accused in court filings of recruiting young girls on Epstein\u2019s behalf. On multiple flights, additional women, listed in the flight logs by their first name or the simple descriptor \u201cfemale,\u201d joined Clinton aboard Epstein\u2019s plane.\n\n2 \u2013 Clinton\u2019s statement leaves out that the former president was reportedly on the airplane with Epstein himself.\n\nThe statement that \u201cin 2002 and 2003, President Clinton took a total of four trips on Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s airplane\u201d seems to imply that Clinton utilized the airplane itself, but conspicuously fails to mention whether Epstein was on board. According to numerous reports, Clinton was a frequent flyer on the pervert\u2019s private airplane, traveling with Epstein and unidentified women on numerous occasions.\n\nEpstein\u2019s fleet reportedly included a Boeing 727-200 passenger jet that normally seats nearly 200, but was modified for private use. Fox News reported Epstein\u2019s plane was \u201coutfitted with a bed where passengers had group sex with young girls.\u201d\n\n3 \u2013 Clinton\u2019s statement claims that his Secret Service detail was present \u201con every leg of every trip\u201d with Epstein. Yet numerous reports allege that Clinton ditched his assigned Secret Service agents on several flights.\n\nClinton\u2019s office\u2019s statement reads:\n\nIn 2002 and 2003, President Clinton took a total of four trips on Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s airplane: one to Europe, one to Asia, and two to Africa, which included stops in connection with the work of the Clinton Foundation. Staff, supporters of the Foundation, and his Secret Service detail traveled on every leg of every trip.\n\nFox News reported that records show Clinton \u201capparently ditching his Secret Service detail for at least five of the flights,\u201d since no agent names appeared on the manifest.\n\nInvestigative journalist Conchita Sarnoff, executive director of Alliance to Rescue Victims of Trafficking, stated, \u201cI know from the pilot logs and these are pilot logs that you know were written by different pilots and at different times that Clinton went, he was a guest of Epstein\u2019s 27 times.\u201d She added that \u201cmany of those times Clinton had his Secret Service with him and many times he did not.\u201d\n\n4 \u2013 Clinton\u2019s statement does not mention that some of the trips reportedly encompassed multiple legs with several other possible flights.\n\nDespite Clinton\u2019s statement claiming that he only took four flights on Epstein\u2019s plane, the Asia trip alone, which flight records show occurred between May 22 and May 25, 2002, was reportedly a five-leg trip.\n\nAccording to Fox News, flight records show Clinton flying to such destinations as \u201cHong Kong, Japan, Singapore, China, Brunei, London, New York, the Azores, Belgium, Norway, Russia and Africa.\u201d\n\n5 \u2013 Clinton denies traveling to Epstein\u2019s so-called Orgy Island. One Epstein accuser disputes that claim.\n\nClinton\u2019s statement says the ex-president has \u201cnever been to Little St. James Island, Epstein\u2019s ranch in New Mexico, or his residence in Florida.\u201d\n\nEpstein accuser Giuffre claimed in the recently unsealed affidavit that she saw Clinton on Epstein\u2019s private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Her claim has not been corroborated.\n\n6 \u2013 Clinton has a long history of credibility issues regarding claims about his mistreatment of women.\n\nClinton famously claimed of Monica Lewinsky, \u201cI did not have sexual relations with that woman,\u201d but was later impeached by the House of Representatives for lying under oath about this relationship with the White House intern. He also denied credible sexual assault accusations by Juanita Broaddrick, Paula Jones, and Kathleen Willey, among others.\n\nFollow Joshua Klein on Twitter @JoshuaKlein.", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/08/02/flashback-hillary-campaign-monitored-news-about-jeffrey-epsteins-associations-with-bill-clinton/", "published": "2020-08-02T00:00:00"}, {"title": "NBC\u2019s Todd: Trump\u2019s \u2018Un-American\u2019 Election Delay Suggestion Exposes His \u2018Desperation\u2019", "text": "Sunday on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d host Chuck Todd said President Donald Trump\u2019s tweet that suggested to delay the November election was \u201cthe most un-American and un-democratic of suggestions, which he said exposed his \u201cdesperation.\u201d\n\nTodd said, \u201cGood Sunday morning. So much for that new tone. This past week President Trump retweeted a video of a doctor who said masks were unnecessary, hydroxychloroquine is a cure for Covid-19, and that diseases are caused by dreams of sex with demons. Meanwhile, the number of deaths from Covid-19 passed 150,000. Nine states set one-day records for C cases, while 11 set single-day records for deaths. Among those deaths was former Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain. Cain was diagnosed shortly after attending the president\u2019s rally in Tulsa.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cWe learned that economic output fell in the last quarter by the largest amount since records have been kept, at an annualized rate of 32.9 percent. And that was even before extra unemployment benefits for tens of millions of Americans ran out on Friday. And finally, President Trump made the most un-American and un-democratic of suggestions: proposing to delay the election, insisting again, without evidence, that mail-in voting will result in a fraudulent outcome. And remember, that of this was just this past week. Mr. Trump\u2019s delay-the-election gambit had the scent of a president who was seeking a distraction from the terrible economic news, a president whose desperation makes him even more unpredictable. In short, a president who expects to lose. Ultimately, Mr. Trump increasingly looks like a man who believes that the more the virus spins out of control, the more his presidency does, too.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/clips/2020/08/02/nbcs-todd-trumps-un-american-election-delay-suggestion-exposes-his-desperation/", "published": "2020-08-02T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Pirro: \u2018We Are Living in an Upside-Down World\u2019 \u2014 Truth and Honesty \u2018Essential,\u2019 But \u2018Clouded by the Politics of Lies\u2019", "text": "Saturday, Fox News Channel\u2019s Jeanine Pirro opened her \u201cJustice\u201d program calling for the country to \u201cget back on track.\u201d\n\nHowever, she noted that with 93 days to go until the presidential election, everything was shrouded by politics.\n\nTranscript as follows:\n\nPIRRO: Let\u2019s get right to me open \u2014 as to what is right and what is wrong. It\u2019s time to make up your own mind. You\u2019re simply going to have to rely on yourself.\n\nExhibit 1: you cannot open your business if you own a gym. In fact, you risk arrest and loss of your license no matter how hard you try to comply with the rules, how hard you clean the facility, how much distance you put between gym members, but no stress. If you want to mass protests, have at it.\n\nGovernor Phil Murphy exempted political protests from pandemic restrictions and joined thousands to protest. Go for it, guys. It\u2019s your time. But don\u2019t you dare go to work.\n\nMakes sense to you?\n\nBut just today, Atilus gym owners made up their own minds as to what was right and used force to open up their gym that had been barricaded by the state. The consequences of their actions are yet to be seen.\n\nExhibit 2: you cannot go to church, synagogue or a mosque in numbers of more than 50, but multiply that number or bring 499 of your friends and all 500 of you hit a movie theater down the street, or hell, all of you show up at a casino, hang out, play blackjack, hit the roulette wheel, throw some craps? So says the United States Supreme Court.\n\nYes. There\u2019s a cap on the number of people who can attend religious services at 50, but not for profit companies like casinos and theaters that can have 500. And you can thank Justice John Roberts for joining the left yet again and praise President Trump\u2019s appointee, Neil Gorsuch, for the dissent that reads quote, \u201cThere is no world in which the Constitution permits Nevada to favor Caesar\u2019s Palace over Calvary Chapel.\u201d Makes sense to you?\n\nExhibit 3: you cannot protect Federal Courthouses in this country because if you do, you\u2019re a violent occupying force who brings terror on peaceful protesters, the ones who are actually bombing, burning and destroying those courthouses.\n\nIf you protect these Halls of Justice, you are nothing more than the enemy bringing fear to city streets. So says Oregon\u2019s Governor Kate Brown and Portland\u2019s Mayor Ted Wheeler.\n\nForget that the leftists have injured over 240 Department of Homeland Security Officers and intentionally blinded three over more than 60 days of violent upheaval. Forget that that 40 USC Section 1315 requires the Department of Homeland Security to protect Federal property.\n\nForget that neighbors are frightened, petrified, and haven\u2019t slept in more than 60 days. Makes sense to you?\n\nExhibit 4: you cannot use hydroxychloroquine as a possible therapeutic for use in the early stages of the coronavirus as it can kill you, and it\u2019s now actually against the law in one state to use it off label.\n\nThe drug that has been used for 60 years is now demonized, marginalized, and in some states, banned for use as a treatment because President Donald Trump dared to mention it. In spite of the fact that scores of frontline doctors and healthcare workers continuously recommend its benefits, along with zinc and Z-Pak for use prophylactically and in the early stages of the virus.\n\nOur own Dr. Mark Siegel prescribed it for his dad and said it was a miracle cure for him, and yet to others. It must be outlawed. Makes sense to you?\n\nExhibit 5: Dr. Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Health and Infectious Diseases for over 40 years who supposedly understands infectious diseases, has told us that the people of the United States don\u2019t need to be worried about COVID because it\u2019s not a major threat. We don\u2019t need to wear masks. Then we need to wear masks.\n\nThat it\u2019s okay to hook up on Tinder, but plan to never shake hands again. That we shouldn\u2019t use hydroxychloroquine because it\u2019s ineffective and calls studies flawed that show that it is effective. As a physician responsible for public health, should he not be receptive to all observations made by doctors on the frontlines? Not just chase the vaccine, but find ways to address symptoms and complications and arrest the progression of a viral disease?\n\nDoes this make sense to you?\n\nExhibit 6: more than 100 police agencies have backed out of security for the Milwaukee DNC after their Civilian Oversight Commission denied police the use of teargas and pepper spray to maintain crowd control during out of control protests. Makes sense to you?\n\nFolks, we are living in an upside-down world where politics is the deciding factor for all things work, play, religion, safety and health. This is not a good place to be.\n\nTruth and honesty are essential, but when clouded by the politics of lies, they are almost impossible to find.\n\nYou have 93 days.

Trump has now made more than 20,000 misleading or false statements according to the Washington Post. It\u2019s a fool\u2019s errand to enter the ring with someone who can\u2019t follow the rules or the truth. Biden will undoubtedly take heat from Republicans and the media for skipping the debates. But it\u2019s worth the risk as trying to debate someone incapable of telling the truth is an impossible contest to win.\n\nCNN political analyst @joelockhart tells @smerconish that Joe Biden shouldn\u2019t debate President Trump. Trump \u201cwill take the truth and destroy it, and Biden will be in the position of correcting him over and over and over again. I don't think he should give him that platform.\u201d pic.twitter.com/4EOR4Q9Um7 \u2014 CNN (@CNN) August 1, 2020\n\nHowever, Biden has been criticized in past debate performances for his misstatements and outright fabrications. In a debate with Alaska Governor Sarah Palin in 2008, Biden made several false claims, including the odd claim that the United States and France had \u201ckicked Hezbollah out of Lebanon.\u201d (Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed terrorist group with an associated political wing, is still very much there, and is a major part of Lebanon\u2019s government.)\n\nIn 2012, as he debated then-Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI), Biden again told a series of whoppers, including the false claim that Obamacare was not forcing religious institutions to provide contraceptive coverage. That very issue has been at the heart of lawsuits brought by Little Sisters of the Poor, a Catholic order that had been required to pay for contraception.\n\nThe Biden campaign agreed in June that the candidate will participate in three debates. But Democrats are worried that the aging Biden, who has had trouble articulating his views in past debates, will look frail next to President Trump \u2014 or that Trump will get away with false statements.\n\nFor example, the New York Times\u2018 Thomas Friedman wrote last month that Biden should not debate Trump unless he releases his tax returns and unless the debate has real-time fact-checking.\n\nSuch \u201creal-time\u201d fact-checking proved decisive in a 2012 debate between President Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney: CNN moderator Candy Crowley incorrectly declared that Obama was right about having declared that the Benghazi terror attack was, in fact, a terror attack.

In a sign of the extreme levels of uncertainty around jobs numbers in the pandemic era, economists surveyed by Dow Jones forecast a 1 million jobs gain.\n\nThe economic disruption from the coronavirus has made it far more difficult to measure or predict changes in the U.S. labor market. ADP\u2019s recent numbers have been off by millions when compared with the Labor Department\u2019s monthly report on the employment situation. In June, for example, ADP saw private payrolls expanding by 2.369 million a few days before the official report said payrolls expanded by 4.8 million, almost all of which was private sector employment.\n\n\u201cThe labor market recovery slowed in the month of July,\u201d said Ahu Yildirmaz, vice president and co-head of the ADP Research Institute. \u201cWe have seen the slowdown impact businesses across all sizes and sectors.\u201d\n\nLarge businesses, those with over 500 workers, added 129,000, ADP said.

Financial services, however, shed 18,000 jobs. Information dropped by 1,000.\n\nThe June report was revised up to show that businesses added 4.3 million jobs in the month, up from the initial ADP report of 2.4 million.

In truth, they seem to be waiting for Republicans to fold. \u2014 Jake Sherman (@JakeSherman) August 4, 2020\n\nDemocrats are sticking to the HEROES Act \u2014 a $3 trillion, 1,815-page monstrosity passed by the Democrat-controlled House in May that includes a number of purely political provisions.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported at the time, the HEROES Act was so radical that it was opposed by moderate Democrats. It provides massive giveaways to the \u201cgreen\u201d energy industry; provides $10 million in pork to the National Endowment for the Arts; requires national mail-in voting and \u201cballot harvesting\u201c; and lifts the cap on the SALT deduction \u2014 providing a massive tax cut for the rich in blue states. Democrats hope that Republicans will eventually be forced to accept the bill.\n\nRepublicans have proposed a $1 trillion alternative, focused more narrowly on immediate economic relief. They have also insisted on protecting employers from lawsuits related to coronavirus \u2014 a key concern for small businesses and non-profit organizations as they contemplate reopening. The GOP has also proposed reducing the additional federal unemployment aid from $600 per week to $200 per week, so workers have an incentive to seek new jobs rather than staying on relief.\n\nThere is room for compromise, as well as for a solution that helps state and local governments that are facing massive cash crunches \u2014 without bailing out profligate blue states like Illinois and California. But talks have been deadlocked.\n\nDemocrats even rejected a one-week extension at the $600 level. The result is that millions of Americans will experience a sudden drop in income. Pelosi is taking her sweet time: maybe there will be a deal this week, and maybe there won\u2019t.\n\nEvidently the politicians on Capitol Hill believe that the real deadline is November \u2014 that they can dawdle on renewing federal assistance and then blame the other side (i.e. Republicans) for the pain being experienced by American families, and for the sudden reduction in consumer spending that has, thus far, been keeping the economy afloat. There is only one way to force Congress \u2014 mainly Pelosi \u2014 to take action, and that is to withhold pay to members of Congress themselves.\n\nThe Constitution states: \u201cThe Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.\u201d Mnuchin should withhold their paychecks, on the argument that Congress is not actually providing a service.\n\nCongress would sue, and would probably win, but the point would be made that politicians are unwilling to endure the hardship that they are, by their inaction, imposing on others.\n\nJoel B.

For example, in recent weeks, tech job postings are about 36 percent below where they were at the same time last year.\n\nEconomist AnnElizabeth Konkel writes that the U.S. tech job market is \u201cshowing no signs of bouncing back.\u201d\n\nSimultaneously, stay-at-home orders have driven up competition among American professionals for tech jobs, Konkel writes:\n\nAs tech postings have declined, relative job seeker interest in the sector has risen. In February, tech job postings received 68% of the clicks of the average posting. By July 24, tech postings were attracting 95% of the clicks of the average job. More clicks per posting means that, relative to employment opportunities, more people are interested in these jobs than in the pre-COVID era. This greater competition could spell a loss of bargaining power for tech workers. If more people want these jobs, tech companies may scale back benefits like unlimited personal time off. [Emphasis added] \u2026 With fewer tech job postings and increased job seeker interest, in the field, competition for sector jobs is heating up. Companies are back in the driver\u2019s seat, which could reduce tech worker bargaining power. In addition, benefits like unlimited time off and well-stocked snack bars could go on the chopping block. At the same time though, substantial geographic diversification of the tech workforce could occur if the sector widely adopts permanent remote work. Unless that happens, jobs may continue to concentrate in the major tech hubs, tightening the hold of places like Silicon Valley on this strategic part of the economy. [Emphasis added]\n\nThe increased tech job competition comes as President Trump moves to protect American workers in the tech industry from being replaced by imported H-1B visa workers \u2014 as had recently begun occurring at the federally owned Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA).\n\nIn the midst of record unemployment \u2014 where 30 to 40 million Americans remain unemployed and underemployed \u2014 the TVA had started outsourcing 200 \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d tech jobs to H-1B visa workers by contracting them through outsourcing firms like Capgemini, CGI, and Accenture.\n\nThe TVA outsourcing scheme spurred a campaign by grassroots activists with U.S. Tech Workers, including former Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Protect U.S. Workers\u2019 Sara Blackwell. The activists blasted the TVA\u2019s outsourcing in the midst of mass unemployment and asked Trump to intervene.\n\nOn Monday, Trump signed an executive order to require all federal agencies to complete internal audits to assess their compliance with requirements ensuring only American citizens are given federal civil service jobs.\n\n\"Today, I am signing an executive order to ensure that the Federal government lives by a very simple rule: Hire American.\" \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 pic.twitter.com/G8YGU99XMb \u2014 The White House (@WhiteHouse) August 3, 2020\n\nLikewise, the Department of Labor will soon finalize guidance to prevent employers from importing foreign H-1B visa workers at an outsourcing firm in order to displace American workers at another company, as is often the practice.\n\nThe order comes as Trump has already signed an order that has halted the inflow of a number of foreign visa workers \u2014 freeing up likely 600,000 U.S. jobs \u2014 to reduce competition against unemployed Americans and drive up wages.\n\nThere are about 650,000 H-1B visa workers in the U.S. at any given moment. Americans are often laid off in the process and forced to train their foreign replacements, as highlighted by Breitbart News. More than 85,000 Americans annually potentially lose their jobs to foreign labor through the H-1B visa program.\n\nAnalysis conducted in 2018 discovered that 71 percent of tech workers in Silicon Valley, California, are foreign-born, while the tech industry in the San Francisco, Oakland, and Hayward area is made up of 50 percent foreign-born tech workers.

The Department of Labor will also finalize guidance to prevent H-1B employers from moving H-1B workers to other employers\u2019 job sites to displace American workers.\n\n\u201cOutsourcing hundreds of workers is especially detrimental in the middle of a pandemic, which has already cost millions of Americans their jobs,\u201d the statement said. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s actions will help combat employers\u2019 misuse of H-1B visas, which were never intended to replace qualified American workers with low-cost foreign labor.\u201d\n\nFederal data shows the feds & states employ 18K+ #H1B foreign workers instead of Americans.\n\nSo there's an easy way for Pres.

Trump initially dismissed the advertisement:\n\nTrump called our ad FAKE. We're thrilled. But there's nothing \"Fake\" about Trump's $8 million employee replacing American TVA workers with foreign workers. What happened to putting American workers 1st? RT this.

The invite list included several TVA workers: Gay Henson, President of the TVA\u2019s Engineering Association, plus Chuck Charnawskas, Jonathan Hicks, David Littlejohn, Linda McDonald, Renae McKenzie, Wendy Turner, and Stacy Whetzell.\n\n\u201cThis is a really significant date for U.S. tech workers,\u201d said Kevin Lynn, founder of U.S. Tech Workers, a grassroots group of U.S. college-graduate professionals. U.S. graduates know \u201cwhat decades of outsourcing and offshoring of these valuable jobs have done to themselves personally and collectively, to the country,\u201d he said, adding:\n\nWe\u2019ve been very much involved for the last three years to protect and preserve tech worker jobs here in the U.S. and in particular, fighting outsourcing schemes. So this is a great opportunity for us, it\u2019s really a culmination of a lot of hard work \u2026 [We\u2019re] really, really overjoyed as of this time that the president of the United States has chosen to act on behalf of American workers.\n\nFortune 500 companies and their networks of U.S. and Indian-owned subcontractors and sub-subcontractor have used the H-1B program to outsource millions of college-graduate jobs over the last 20 years.\n\nCurrently, Fortune 500 companies keep at least 1.3 million foreign contract-workers in jobs needed by U.S. graduates, including at least 600,000 H-1B workers. This personnel policy is not an \u201cabuse\u201d of the law because the law was carefully drafted to help companies sideline American workers.\n\nSome of the contract workers are hired by prestigious firms at U.S. wages. But many visa workers are employed by subcontractors at below-market wages, and many are hired as gig-worker for minimal wages. For example, the universities help get \u201cPractical Training\u201d work permits for 500,000 foreign graduates each year. These workers do not have to be paid minimum wages, and they are widely used by Fortune 500 subcontractors.\n\nMany executives prefer hiring contract workers because they are compliant and quiet compared to U.S. professionals who can argue with executives and switch jobs.\n\nMany of the contract workers are imported for about a year, so they can learn how to do the job from an office in India.\n\nMany foreign workers accept low wages for work in the United States because the U.S. work is preferable to work in India, China, or elsewhere. Also, U.S. employers keep their foreign workers on the job by dangling the promise of green cards and citizenship. For example, at least 300,000 Indian visa workers are working while they wait for promised green cards.\n\nIn his 2017 inauguration address, Trump promised a policy of \u201cBuy American and hire American.\u201d\n\nTrump said in March 2016, \u201cI will end forever the use of the H-1B as a cheap labor program, and institute an absolute requirement to hire American workers first for every visa and immigration program. No exceptions.\u201d\n\nOn June 22, Trump announced a temporary halt to the H-1B inflow and directed his deputies to rewrite regulations on the Fortune 500\u2019s use of foreign contract-workers.\n\nMany US grads are pushed out of jobs so CEOs can hire subservient foreign #H1B visa-workers.\n\nNow the H-1Bs are being put into jobs in the Tenn.

State officials rarely penalize or even look for employers who hire illegal migrants, partly because migration rules are set by the federal government.\n\nThe bill is touted as an aid for the resident population of migrants who are working legally under the 2012 \u201cDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals\u201d (DACA) amnesty.\n\nBut New Jersey also has a large number of illegal aliens, including Mexicans, Central Americans, and a growing number of Indians.\n\nThe law will also open new opportunities for unscrupulous employers to skirt federal laws while using illegal migrants as cheap labor. For example, foreign visitors are allowed to enter and depart the country under the B-1/B-2 visa. They are not allowed to work once they enter the country \u2014 but there are very few enforcement efforts to deter the widespread hiring of B-1/B-2 visitors in jobs needed by Americans.\n\nThe legislation spotlights the deepening alliance between business groups and progressives. In 2019, Murphy also signed a bill allowing illegal aliens to get drivers\u2019 licenses, making it easier for employers to hire illegal migrants for various jobs. In 2013, Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ) was one of the eight senators who pushed the \u201cGang of Eight\u201d amnesty and cheap-labor bill.\n\nThe licensing bill is pushed by Democrat Sen. Nellie Pou. She did not use her Twitter account to tout the bill\u2019s passage.\n\nA variety of donor-funded progressive groups back the legislation. The groups use the #OccupationalLicenses4All hashtag:\n\nProud to stand alongside all of our sisters and brothers who fought for #OccupationalLicenses4All, helping to ensure we can safely staff our healthcare facilities, especially at a time when our state is fighting a pandemic outbreak. #COVID19 #SafeStaffing https://t.co/CJOpue9FNy \u2014 HPAE \u2013 Health Professionals & Allied Employees (@hpaeaft) August 1, 2020\n\nThe tacit alliance has kept New Jersey\u2019s wage growth among the lowest in the nation, despite the Democrats\u2019 policy of raising the government-directed minimum wage.\n\nThe bills were pushed by Democrats but are also supported by some GOP members.\n\nA growing number of other states \u2014 including California and New York \u2014 allow illegal aliens to compete against American licensed experts and professionals.\n\nThere was minimal media coverage of the giveaway bill in the state\u2019s few newspapers. The little coverage focused on the interests of illegal immigrants, not on Americans and legal immigrants. For example, NorthJersey.com led its coverage with a sympathetic coverage of one illegal migrant from El Salvador:\n\nLuis Chirino has spent long hours designing, drawing and building projects to earn a degree in architecture from the New Jersey Institute of Technology, sometimes spending all night in a studio on the Newark campus. But Chirino, 22, who lives in Jersey City, also has wondered whether the long nights of studying will pay off and if he will be able to practice his chosen profession in New Jersey once he graduates. As an immigrant without legal status, he can\u2019t obtain a professional license to work as an architect in New Jersey even if he graduates and passes the required exams. \u2026 In New Jersey, dozens of professions and occupations require licenses, including accountants, architects, acupuncturists, audiologists, beauticians, court reporters, cosmetologists, doctors, dentists, engineers, home inspectors, morticians, nurses, occupational therapists, optometrists, pharmacists, plumbers, psychiatrists, real estate appraisers, social workers and veterinarians.\n\nOn April 2, Fox News reported comments from pro-American critics of cheap-labor migration:\n\n\u201cAllowing those in the country illegally to get occupational or professional licenses takes jobs away from American citizens and legal immigrants,\u201d said FAIR State and Local Engagement Director Shari Randall. \u201cAlready there are more than 1.3 million unemployed individuals in New Jersey who are suffering as a result of the Coronavirus pandemic and lockdowns. Providing occupational or professional licenses to those in the country illegally incentivizes more illegal immigration. With high unemployment, the legislative focus should have been targeted to unemployed citizens and legal immigrants in New Jersey who desperately need to go back to work, instead of encouraging more illegal immigration.\u201d", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/economy/2020/08/02/nj-democrats-ok-valuable-work-licenses-illegal-aliens/", "published": "2020-08-02T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Over 125 China-Backed Companies Get Millions in U.S. PPP Loans", "text": "More than 125 companies owned by or linked to China have received hundreds of millions of dollars in Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans meant for American small businesses during the Chinese coronavirus crisis, a report alleges.\n\nAccording to an analysis by the Horizon Advisory consulting firm, published by the New York Times, anywhere from $192 million to $419 million in PPP loans \u2014 funded by American taxpayers \u2014 has been awarded to more than 125 China-backed companies since March.\n\nThe report states that at least 32 of those China-backed companies have secured loans for more than $1 million, totaling $180 million alone. The loans were intended to help small businesses with fewer than 500 employees stay afloat amid an economic shutdown spurred by the pandemic.\n\nIn one case, Continental Aerospace Technologie and Aviage Systems \u2014 both owned by the Chinese government\u2019s Aviation Industry Corporation of China \u2014 were able to get $10.35 million in PPP loans.\n\nAnother case reveals that U.S. subsidiaries of China\u2019s HNA Group, a financial services corporation, got $1 million each in PPP loans, and a U.S. subsidiary of China\u2019s BGI Group originally got a loan of $1 million. When the media reported the loan, BGI Americas Corporation returned the money.\n\nOther cases include, according to Times:\n\nFor example, Dendreon Pharmaceuticals, a California-based biotech company, received a loan worth $5 million to $10 million. It is owned by Nanjing Xinbai, a Chinese state-invested company whose controlling shareholder has close ties to the Communist Party. [Emphasis added] Money from the Paycheck Protection Program has also made its way to the financial technology sector. Citcon USA LLC, a Silicon Valley mobile payments firm, received $150,000 to $350,000 in loan money. ZhenFund is a major investor; the company connects American companies to Chinese payment platforms such as Alipay and WeChat, which could also face restrictions from the Trump administration. [Emphasis added]\n\nSenate Republicans are currently looking to ensure that such federal loans are not awarded to companies with links to the Communist Party of China. One provision would ban China-backed companies from eligibility for federal loans.\n\nThe report comes as President Trump\u2019s administration seeks a crackdown on Chinese investment in the American economy. Over the weekend, Trump promised to soon ban the China-owned video app TikTok, which has become widely popular among American teens.\n\nOn Sunday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said he would support a U.S. ban on TikTok.\n\nChinese investment in the U.S. economy has reached more than $145 billion, according to data collected by Public Citizen.

Some of the Iranian offerings are even cheaper than our Venezuelan counterparts \u2014 but in a country where the minimum wage isn\u2019t even $4 per month anymore, the products are out of reach for the majority.\n\nIt\u2019s not like you can simply walk in and purchase stuff on a whim either, thanks to the regime\u2019s authoritarian Chinese coronavirus measures. The governor of the State of Miranda, Hector Rodriguez, recently passed a new ruling that limits citizens from purchasing essential goods, only letting them do purchases on specific days of the week determined by the last number of our ID card \u2014 a nightmare from the worst years of the socialist collapse of Venezuela that has once again resurfaced.\n\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning that the locale that this Iranian supermarket is occupying has a picturesque story of its own, tied to the ill-fated exploits of Venezuela\u2019s socialism.\n\nFor some time, the facilities used to belong to the Colombian \u201c\u00c9xito\u201d supermarket chains, and for a time, all was good. In the early days of 2010 (and at the apex of his socialist dream), the now Supreme and Eternal Commander of the Bolivarian Revolution Hugo Ch\u00e1vez decided to expropriate and seize \u00c9xito\u2019s entire chain and infrastructure to bring forth a Corporation of Socialist Markets (COMERSO), of which \u201cAbastos Bicentenario\u201d went onto occupying most of \u00c9xito\u2019s former locations.\n\nI think you can guess what happened next \u2014 it got run to the ground, trashed, obliterated. Shortages, long lines (some even overnight), misery, and all the wondrous experiences of grocery shopping in socialism. The last time I went to one of these was to accompany my mother. The experience was \u2014 depressing, to say the least.\n\nThe failure of Abastos Bicentenario was palliated by the Maduro regime through a new business: Tiendas CLAP \u2014 a tendril in the corrupt machinery of which Alex Saab (a man in the process of being extradited to the United States who some of the regime\u2019s diehard shills have tried to paint as a modern version of Oskar Schindler) is part of. The CLAP is Venezuela\u2019s socialist emergency aid kit system, in which true believers in the Bolivarian Revolution are rewarded with insect-infested rice, \u201cyellow\u201d milk, and rotten fish flesh.\n\nWith that also run to the ground, it\u2019s time for some Iranian \u201ccapitalism\u201d to come to the rescue.\n\nFor a regime that expropriated companies, seized land, and persecuted private entrepreneurship in the name of Socialist \u201cfood sovereignty\u201d to give it all away to Iran is not just baffling, but a testament to the failure of their misbegotten ideology.\n\nThe Iranian influence in our country grows \u2013 Iranian oil, military, and now food flood the country. This brand new supermarket has already been denounced as a front for money laundering \u2014 which wouldn\u2019t be too far-fetched if true, given the rise of bodegones (stores that sell imported goods without issue), despite the regime\u2019s U.S.-sanction related narratives stating otherwise. I personally don\u2019t see myself visiting these facilities anytime soon \u2013 not only are they a bit far from where I live (made worse by the limited transportation options due to coronavirus\u2019 quarantine and the severe gasoline shortages), but I would only be able to purchase anything on Mondays and Saturdays.\n\nNo halal meat for me, I guess.

The face behind this venture is Issa Rezaei, a man who has ties to Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and its missile program \u2014 I suppose that having the military control food distribution is something both regimes have in common.\n\nThe narratives by the regime\u2019s media machine, of course, have trumpeted this \u201ctriumph\u201d as much as possible, despite its reach hindered by no longer being able to latch onto DirecTV\u2019s infrastructure.\n\nThe creation of a \u201cNew World,\u201d the cooperation between Iran and Venezuela, breaking the U.S. sanctions, and the White House\u2019s \u201csupremacy\u201d are some of the components of the narrative expunged by our flamboyant vice president during the opening of this store.\n\nThe supermarket is located far from the more impoverished parts of the capital \u2013 in Terrazas del Avila, an area that, while belonging to the State of Miranda, is part of the Metropolitan Region of Caracas.\n\nFancy, clean, with high tech dystopian checkpoints for Chinese Coronavirus prevention (which don\u2019t seem to prevent their employees from getting infected), and, most importantly, stocked, it\u2019s almost too good to be true. The products display their price tags not in bolivars, but on the \u201cGreat Satan\u2019s\u201d greenbacks, the same U.S. dollars that were once illegal for us to hold and trade \u2013 for which we had to use clever wordsmithing, such as \u201cverdes\u201d (greens), \u201clechugas\u201d (lettuces), and even \u201cTrumps\u201d \u2013 that are now keeping whatever is left of our economy afloat.\n\nWhile the prices themselves are expressed in foreign currency, they do seem to be within range of other supermarkets in the country: $5.92 for Lacteos Los Andes\u2019 powdered milk (a company that was seized by the regime in 2008), $2.53 for a liter of corn oil, or $2.32 for a can of Iranian tomato paste. Some of the Iranian offerings are even cheaper than our Venezuelan counterparts \u2014 but in a country where the minimum wage isn\u2019t even $4 per month anymore, the products are out of reach for the majority.\n\nIt\u2019s not like you can simply walk in and purchase stuff on a whim either, thanks to the regime\u2019s authoritarian Chinese coronavirus measures. The governor of the State of Miranda, Hector Rodriguez, recently passed a new ruling that limits citizens from purchasing essential goods, only letting them do purchases on specific days of the week determined by the last number of our ID card \u2014 a nightmare from the worst years of the socialist collapse of Venezuela that has once again resurfaced.\n\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning that the locale that this Iranian supermarket is occupying has a picturesque story of its own, tied to the ill-fated exploits of Venezuela\u2019s socialism.\n\nFor some time, the facilities used to belong to the Colombian \u201c\u00c9xito\u201d supermarket chains, and for a time, all was good. In the early days of 2010 (and at the apex of his socialist dream), the now Supreme and Eternal Commander of the Bolivarian Revolution Hugo Ch\u00e1vez decided to expropriate and seize \u00c9xito\u2019s entire chain and infrastructure to bring forth a Corporation of Socialist Markets (COMERSO), of which \u201cAbastos Bicentenario\u201d went onto occupying most of \u00c9xito\u2019s former locations.\n\nI think you can guess what happened next \u2014 it got run to the ground, trashed, obliterated. Shortages, long lines (some even overnight), misery, and all the wondrous experiences of grocery shopping in socialism. The last time I went to one of these was to accompany my mother. The experience was \u2014 depressing, to say the least.\n\nThe failure of Abastos Bicentenario was palliated by the Maduro regime through a new business: Tiendas CLAP \u2014 a tendril in the corrupt machinery of which Alex Saab (a man in the process of being extradited to the United States who some of the regime\u2019s diehard shills have tried to paint as a modern version of Oskar Schindler) is part of. The CLAP is Venezuela\u2019s socialist emergency aid kit system, in which true believers in the Bolivarian Revolution are rewarded with insect-infested rice, \u201cyellow\u201d milk, and rotten fish flesh.\n\nWith that also run to the ground, it\u2019s time for some Iranian \u201ccapitalism\u201d to come to the rescue.\n\nFor a regime that expropriated companies, seized land, and persecuted private entrepreneurship in the name of Socialist \u201cfood sovereignty\u201d to give it all away to Iran is not just baffling, but a testament to the failure of their misbegotten ideology.\n\nThe Iranian influence in our country grows \u2013 Iranian oil, military, and now food flood the country. This brand new supermarket has already been denounced as a front for money laundering \u2014 which wouldn\u2019t be too far-fetched if true, given the rise of bodegones (stores that sell imported goods without issue), despite the regime\u2019s U.S.-sanction related narratives stating otherwise. I personally don\u2019t see myself visiting these facilities anytime soon \u2013 not only are they a bit far from where I live (made worse by the limited transportation options due to coronavirus\u2019 quarantine and the severe gasoline shortages), but I would only be able to purchase anything on Mondays and Saturdays.\n\nNo halal meat for me, I guess. Time to stick to my regular off-market provider.\n\nChristian K. Caruzo is a Venezuelan writer and documents life under socialism.

Yet after two decades of socialist rule and the seizure of its major oil company, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, its oil production has dropped to 1940s levels, necessitating imports of gasoline from allied countries like Iran. Major fuel shortages have forced thousands nationwide to stand in crowds in front of gas stations, even under a Chinese coronavirus lockdown, and have led to violence over the little gasoline available, with at least two deaths.\n\nPacheco stands accused of having uploaded a video to social media July 31 showing a Trujillo Fire Department ambulance stuck on the road. several men begin pushing it from behind to get it to a fuel source. The video shows the ambulance moving with the effort of multiple men as the large letters on its side reading \u201cRescue \u2014 Socialist Government of the State of Trujillo\u201d pass by glacially. One of the men pushing can be heard complaining, \u201ccome help push instead of standing there recording,\u201d to which two or three others respond and join the pushers.\n\nAnother unidentified voice can be heard saying, \u201cand the governor says there is no problem with the gasoline \u2014 look, the firefighters\u2019 rescue truck without gasoline!\u201d\n\nAccording to Espacio P\u00fablico, an NGO that operates in Venezuela, officials with the socialist regime\u2019s Scientific, Penal, and Criminal Investigations Body (CICPC) raided Pacheco\u2019s home Monday and arrested him. He is reportedly facing \u201cthree or four charges, among them \u2018terrorism\u2019 and \u2018incitement to hate.'\u201d\n\nDictator Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, having lost control of the National Assembly in the nation\u2019s last democratic elections in 2015, created an illegal parallel legislature known as the \u201cnational constituents\u2019 assembly\u201d in 2017 to pass laws favorable to the socialists. Among the first laws passed by the body, which consisted of Maduro allies such as his son and his wife, was the Law Against Hatred and Fascism, which allows Maduro\u2019s police to arrest anyone threatening \u201cpeaceful coexistence\u201d with the regime. The regime has used the law with increased frequency not just against prominent dissidents, but against anyone speaking out against the regime or exposing the realities of its failures in any way.\n\nThe fuel situation in Venezuela \u2014 a nation that, prior to socialism, was used to abundant and nearly free gasoline \u2014 has deteriorated significantly in the past year. Overall oil production fell to levels unseen since 1947 this June at 374,000 barrels per day, compared to the about 1.3 million barrels per day experts believe Venezuela\u2019s six largest oil refineries can produce. The steep decline occurred after the expropriation of PDVSA under Ch\u00e1vez, who replaced seasoned oil executives and engineers with socialist cronies who brought minimal talent and experience to the job.\n\nThe socialist government of the state of T\u00e1chira, the westernmost in the country and often the most aggressively anti-socialist, announced in late July that it would stop selling any gasoline at all \u2014 a shock to those in the state, who were told not that the move was necessary because of the well-documented shortages, but because of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe need to fuel vehicles has made enforcing the lockdowns difficult for Maduro\u2019s regime. Venezuelans have stood on long, tightly spaced lines for months to get minimal fuel rations, to buy food and, for the few that have steady employment, go to work. The tension on those lines has resulted in street fights and escalated violence, including at the hands of Maduro soldiers.\n\nMaduro\u2019s attorney general announced last week that police had arrested four soldiers and two civilians for killing Carlos Chaparro, a 47-year-old Venezuelan who was protesting the gasoline shortages when he was killed. Venezuela has seen exponential growth in police brutality in the last decade, particularly under Maduro. Police in the country killed thousands, most of them unarmed protesters, during the peak of the anti-socialist movement in 2014-2016. The violence particularly affects minors. Children as young as 11 have reported extensive torture at the hands of police. Police have shot to death at least two 14-year-olds in the past five years.\n\nTeens also face violence when seeking to refuel. In mid-July, similar to Chaparro\u2019s case, assailants killed an 18-year-old during a scuffle at a line for gasoline rations. The Maduro regime has not yet identified the culprits.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2020/08/04/venezuela-man-arrested-filming-socialist-ambulance-running-out-gas/#disqus_thread", "published": "2020-08-04T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Facebook Removes Conservative Brazilian Accounts After Court Order", "text": "Facebook announced on Sunday that it would comply with a Brazilian Supreme Court order to remove 12 accounts belonging to supporters of President Jair Bolsonaro.\n\nThe court claimed that the accounts were guilty of \u201cfake news\u201d and forced the American company to delete them.

At the time, a Chinese fleet of at least 260 vessels was inching \u201cvery close\u201d to the edge of Ecuador\u2019s exclusive economic zone, which surrounds the Gal\u00e1pagos, the archipelago\u2019s governor, Norman Wray, said.\n\n\u201cWe firmly support Ecuador\u2019s efforts to ensure [People\u2019s Republic of China] PRC-flagged vessels do not engage in illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing and stand with States whose economies and natural resources are threatened by PRC-flagged vessels\u2019 disregard for the rule of law and responsible fishing practices,\u201d Pompeo said in Sunday\u2019s statement.\n\n\u201cChina subsidizes the world\u2019s largest commercial fishing fleet, which routinely violates the sovereign rights and jurisdiction of coastal states, fishes without permission, and overfishes licensing agreements \u2026 The Ecuadorian government has \u2026 rais[ed] the alarm about the hundreds of PRC-flagged vessels fishing near Ecuador\u2019s important Gal\u00e1pagos marine reserve and harvesting endangered sharks for their fins, along with many other protected species,\u201d the statement read.\n\nWith nearly 300 vessels, the Chinese-led fleet represents a major logistical undertaking. To remain at sea for long periods of time, a fishing fleet of its size requires special storage and supply vessels.\n\n\u201cThere are suspicions, so far unconfirmed, that the Chinese fleet is being aided by South American associates because it is so far from home. For example, they could be selling it fuel,\u201d Luis Su\u00e1rez, vice president and executive director of Conservation International in Ecuador, said last week.\n\nThe largely Chinese fleet includes \u201cLiberian \u2014 and Panamanian-flagged boats,\u201d Ecuador\u2019s foreign minister, Luis Gallegos, said last week. Ecuador seeks \u201cdeeper coordination\u201d with Panama, Colombia, Peru, and China\u2019s closest Latin American ally, Chile, \u201con protecting the eastern tropical Pacific,\u201d Gallegos said.\n\nEndangered whale and hammerhead sharks are among the species prevalent in the waters of the Gal\u00e1pagos Marine Reserve; the sharks are especially vulnerable to China\u2019s illegal fishing fleets, which target them.\n\nIt is possible that \u201clong fishing lines from the Chinese vessels could be drifting into [Ecuador\u2019s] exclusive economic zone,\u201d Luis Villanueva, a member of the Pew Bertarelli Ocean Legacy Project, said last Thursday, adding that this has yet to be proven.\n\nIn 2017, Ecuador seized a Chinese boat fishing within the boundaries of the Gal\u00e1pagos Marine Reserve. Ecuadorian authorities arrested 20 of its crew members, who were found with 6,000 sharks on board.\n\nA UNESCO World Heritage site, the archipelago is protected for its high levels of endemism, or \u201cspecies found nowhere else on earth,\u201d according to the Galap\u00e1gos Conservancy.

Escalating violence in Portland. A surge of rioting in Seattle. Police in Chicago ambushed. Daily confrontations are happening again. The premeditated violence has inspired violence elsewhere. That ripple effect is always the intent.\n\nWe know this, not only from Chinese communists and European fascists, but from socialists in Latin America.\n\nThe summer riots in the United States followed similar patterns as those in Latin America last year. The \u201cbreeze\u201d of legitimate protests in urban areas after the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis quickly escalated into a \u201churricane\u201d of violence against government institutions and private businesses. These were specific targets that represent national sovereignty and free markets, respectively.\n\nFew Americans have probably heard of the \u201cBolivarian Breeze\u201d or the \u201cBolivarian Hurricane\u201d\u2014 phrases used by Diosdado Cabello, a U.S.-indicted drug trafficker in Venezuela and an influential member of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s political party. He used those phrases to describe the organized riots that hit, among other countries, Chile, Ecuador, and Colombia in 2019. Fewer have probably heard of the \u201cBolivarian Alliance\u201d from which the phrase originates.\n\nHere is a quick refresher.\n\nOnce led by Hugo Ch\u00e1vez of Venezuela and now Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, the Bolivarian Alliance can be best understood as a transnational effort to achieve 21st-century socialism in the Americas. At its zenith, the alliance consisted of 11 countries and three observers, including Iran and Syria. The Bolivarian Alliance has most recently morphed into a political-criminal network that seeks to destabilize American communities through the purposeful deployment of cocaine. It has also fomented unrest in those Latin American countries pursuing free market and democratic reforms.\n\nIn mid-October 2019, Chile saw protests against a 4-cent rate hike on public transit escalate into organized, mass riots. Much like in the aftermath of George Floyd\u2019s death, professional agitators attempted to and, in some cases, successfully burned government buildings and private companies.\n\nThat same month, activists and instigators tied to Venezuela and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) \u2013 a communist guerrilla movement in Latin America and ally of the Maduro regime \u2013 caused so much violence in Ecuador that President Lenin Moreno had to leave the capital. All this after the Moreno government announced a plan to end fuel subsidies.\n\nProtests then broke out in Colombia in November in response to the government\u2019s plan for pension reform. When the protests turned violent, civilian groups with ties to the FARC were found to have been at the \u201cforefront\u201d of the subsequent unrest.\n\nIn early 2020, Diosdado Cabello bragged that this \u201cBolivarian Hurricane\u201d in Latin America would soon strike the United States.\n\nAmericans then watched as outspoken Maduro supporters fomented unrest in Miami in June 2020. Some protesters flew flags of the socialist Sandinista party of Nicaragua in South Florida, while some in Minneapolis waved the flag of the Mapuche indigenous group in Chile. Agitators in D.C. sported Hugo Ch\u00e1vez imagery. All iconography that represents the Bolivarian Network.\n\nIn Bolivia, riots that followed the resignation of former President Evo Morales last year were accompanied by insurgent tactics by Evo and his supporters to try and block food from entering urban cities. Bolivian authorities published audio of an intercept conversation Morales personally had with a henchmen in which he is heard saying exactly this: \u201cdon\u2019t let food into the cities.\u201d A concerning sign of things to come should U.S. socialist and anarchist agitators follow the playbook of their South American counterparts.\n\nThe recent U.S. protests have been accompanied by statues being torn down, street names being changed, and brands reevaluating mascots and taglines. A Venezuelan actress living in the United States expressed concerns over the trajectory of these developments, writing on social media that: \u201cstatues came down \u2013 [Hugo] Ch\u00e1vez didn\u2019t want that history displayed \u2026 and then he changed the street names \u2026 then came the school curriculum \u2026 then some movies couldn\u2019t be shown, then certain TV channels, and so on and so forth.\u201d\n\nFor many in Latin America, socialism is more than just a failed theory or ideology. For those in Venezuela, Cuba, Nicaragua, and more, socialism represents repressive regimes where citizens no longer have a voice or a vote. Those failures are now being exported to other countries through mass national protests, themselves long departed from their original grievance. Venezuela\u2019s Maduro regime and its allies have turned unrest into an asymmetric weapon of warfare, intent on destabilizing the neighborhood.\n\nAmerica remains well positioned to push back against the socialist threat because of the economic principles to which it subscribes. Free markets, more than any other freedom, defy the privileges of the socialist elite and expose their fraudulent ideologies.\n\nDavid Grantham is a Senior Fellow for the Center for a Secure Free Society (SFS) and author of the book Consequences: An Intelligence Officer\u2019s War.

The work the spies did in Miami resulted in the unanswered killing of four U.S. citizens in 1996.\n\nThose outraged by the film note that those the spies killed are left out of the narrative entirely. Instead, the film portrays almost the entire Cuban exile community as a terrorist cell and the spies as patriots braving the danger of free American society to save one of the most brutal communist regimes of the past century.\n\nPrior to the letter, a petition urging Netflix to stop promoting it gathered nearly 20,000 signatures. Ana Margarita Martinez, a real Cuban exile played by the only Cuban star of the movie, Ana de Armas, issued a statement noting that she \u201chad no involvement or was never consulted on\u201d the project.\n\n\u201cEvery person seeing this film is contributing to the proliferation of the Castro regime\u2019s propaganda. I call out to anyone who stands for truth, to avoid watching this film and show the streaming service how this type of content is simply a bad investment \u2014 a film which is already a failure having only made USD 1.4 million worldwide to date,\u201d Martinez said.\n\nIn contrast, the film received effusive praise in the pages of Granma, the official newspaper of the Cuban Communist Party, which claimed it \u201cleaves clear, in historical objectivity, that the Cubans infiltrating counterrevolutionary organizations in the Miami exile community had the right to protect the security of their country and thus prevent the wave of attempted terrorist attacks of the 1990s under the auspices of the United States.\u201d\n\nThe film, the communist propaganda outlet declared, \u201cleaves clearly established who are the aggrieved and who are the aggressors.\u201d\n\nThe Assembly of the Cuban Resistance, a human rights group based in Florida, is spearheading the campaign to convince Netflix to begin correcting the error committed by distributing The Wasp Network. Among the signatories are the mayor of Miami, Francis Suarez; the mayor of Doral, Florida, Juan Carlos Bermudez; and members of groups like the 2506 Brigade, the fighters who fought in the Bay of Pigs liberation action thwarted by President John F.

Venezuelan and Nicaraguan activists have also signed the letter, which at press time continues to add signatories.\n\nAmong the many faults listed against the film is the fact that it is based on a novel written by a noted Marxist with very little in common with reality and that some scenes filmed in Cuba were done so on property that Fidel Castro illegally stole from American citizens, potentially opening Netflix up to lawsuits under Cuban Libertad Act, passed in 1996 but only allowed to take effect under President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cThe Pollack Mansion in Havana Cuba for example, is the site location where the wedding reception scene is filmed.

Maduro and Cabello both openly boasted of diplomatic agreements signed at that meeting, though without providing details.\n\nExcerpts Reuters published of the two letters reportedly demanded Moncada clarify that the agreements abided by the strict sanctions placed on North Korea, which were greatly strengthened after its last nuclear weapons test in September 2017.

Brazil\u2019s presidential office, Planalto, stated that he experienced a fever and felt ill when he initially tested positive for the virus, but he never needed hospital care or came close to any life-threatening condition.\n\nOne of the world\u2019s most vocal opponents of lockdowns to prevent the spread of the virus, Bolsonaro argued that only the sick and vulnerable should be isolated and that businesses should be allowed to continue their activities or public health protocol will lead to economic devastation.

At press time, Brazil has confirmed nearly 2.5 million coronavirus cases and a little over 87,000 deaths.\n\nIn March, when the first coronavirus cases began to surface in Latin America, Bolsonaro urged the public to attempt to maintain normalcy in the face of the pandemic.\n\n\u201cThe virus is here, we\u2019re going to have to confront it.

The Brazilian magazine Veja published poll results this weekend finding that Bolsonaro\u2019s approval rating gained about ten percentage points in three months, jumping from 30.3 percent in April to 39.4 percent in July. Bolsonaro\u2019s disapproval in the northeast similar fell 9.3 percent, a change that Veja did not document anywhere else in the country. The magazine noted that Bolsonaro\u2019s approval ratings in that region are still his lowest nationwide.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/health/2020/07/27/brazils-bolsonaro-teases-national-tour-after-beating-coronavirus/", "published": "2020-07-27T00:00:00"}, {"title": "China Gets Closer to Latin America with Chile Trade Deal", "text": "The Chilean Fruit Exporters Association (ASOEX) and the Chinese Chamber of Commerce for the Import and Export of Food and Native Products (CCCFNA) reportedly inked the deal \u201cearly this week, pledging to boost exchanges of technology and technical expertise, support publicity, and improve transparency in trade and customs data to help faster exports.\u201d\n\n\u201cChina has become a very important market for Chilean fresh fruits and we felt that it was necessary to formalize our current way of working \u2026 in these uncertain and challenging times, it has never been more important to facilitate and enhance our cooperation with China,\u201d ASOEX President Ronald Bown said in a statement.\n\n\u201cChile\u2019s exports to China have been growing \u2026 [rapidly] in recent years thanks to targeted marketing campaigns and lower prices [than competitors] that have tapped into Chinese market trends for cheaper high-quality products,\u201d the SCMP writes. \u201cBetween 2017 and 2019, trade data showed the volume of Chilean fruit exports to China \u2013 both fresh and dried \u2013 grew more than 80 percent.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe export of Chilean nectarines, apples, and cherries posted the biggest growth with export volumes rising by up to 600 percent over the two year period,\u201d the newspaper reports, citing ASOEX data. \u201cIn the first two months of 2020, Chile was the largest supplier of fresh fruit to China in terms of value,\u201d ASOEX said.\n\nIn 2005, Chile became the first Latin American country to sign a free-trade agreement with China.

Wang appeared to confirm that China would only make the vaccine universally available to purchase, not as a humanitarian offering.\n\nChina has spent much of the past decade convincing underdeveloped nations to take out predatory loans through its \u201cBelt and Road Initiative\u201d (BRI), a global infrastructure plan in which China offers to give loans to these countries then used to pay for Chinese contractors to built ports, railways, and other infrastructure. When the country defaults on the loan, China seizes the property it built, expanding its influence.\n\nWang reportedly offered the loan at a video conference with Latin American foreign ministers on Thursday, led in tandem with Mexican Foreign Secretary Marcelo Ebrard.\n\n\u201cFacing the global crisis caused by the pandemic and great changes not seen in a century, China\u2019s will to promote strategic and long-term relations with the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States will not change,\u201d Wang said at the conference, according to China\u2019s state-run CGTN. \u201cIts determination to deepen solidarity and cooperation and achieve common development will not change. Its vision of jointly promoting South-South cooperation and improving global governance will not change.\u201d\n\nCGTN added that Wang also promoted something he called the \u201cChina-Latin America digital silk road,\u201d a technological analog to the BRI.\n\nCGTN noted only that Wang promoted \u201cincreasing vaccine research and development\u201d but did not mention any loans in its written coverage of the event. Similarly, the state-run Xinhua news agency omitted any mention of a loan, instead highlighting Wang\u2019s call to promote \u201cthe co-construction of Belt and Road.\u201d\n\n\u201cParticipants expressed appreciation to China for promoting international cooperation in the fight against COVID-19 [the Chinese coronavirus], sharing experience in this regard and pledging to make vaccines an international public good once they are successfully developed,\u201d Xinhua claimed.\n\nNon-state media, in contrast, led its coverage with the offering of the loan. The left-wing propaganda outlet Telesur reported that Wang offered \u201ca credit of one billion dollars so that Latin American and Caribbean countries can access the vaccine against [the Chinese coronavirus].\u201d The Argentine news site Infobae also highlighted the loan, offering a quote from the conference from Wang asserting the vaccine \u201cwill be a universally accessible public good and we will set aside a loan of $1 billion to support access [to it] to nations in the region [Latin America].\u201d\n\nWang\u2019s description of the vaccine as \u201cuniversally accessible\u201d echoed Xi\u2019s assertions at the World Health Assembly, an event hosted by the U.N.\u2019s World Health Organization (W.H.O.).\n\n\u201c[Chinese coronavirus] vaccine development and deployment in China, when available, will be made a global public good,\u201d Xi said at the time. \u201cThis will be China\u2019s contribution to ensuring vaccine accessibility and affordability in developing countries.\u201d\n\nXi notably omitted that the access would come at a price.\n\nChinese laboratories claim to have been working on a vaccine for months. In June, the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) began injecting soldiers with the experimental vaccine; China has not yet made any findings from the vaccinations available to the public. It is unlikely that any negative results would appear in public.\n\nChina\u2019s zeal to rapidly develop a vaccine has led to heightened espionage and attempts at intellectual property theft in the United States, according to multiple senior officials. The FBI and Department of Homeland Security warned of hacking operations presumed to be by Chinese agents to steal coronavirus research in May, according to the Wall Street Journal and New York Times.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s long history of bad behavior in cyberspace is well documented, so it shouldn\u2019t surprise anyone they are going after the critical organizations involved in the nation\u2019s response to the Covid-19 pandemic,\u201d Christopher Krebs, the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, told the New York Times at the time.\n\n\u201cI have little doubt that the Chinese intelligence services are actively trying to steal America\u2019s intellectual property as it relates to the virus that they unleashed on the world, because, of course, they want to be the country that claims credit for finding those drugs or finding a vaccine, and then use it as leverage against the rest of the world,\u201d Sen.

Such doctors do not receive a living wage and have no right to freely travel, see family, or otherwise exist without extreme government supervision. The Cuban slave doctor program nets the Communist Party an estimated $11 billion a year, the vast majority of which never reaches the doctors. Human Rights Watch referred to the slave doctor program as \u201cdraconian\u201d and a violation of \u201cfundamental rights\u201d in a statement condemning it Wednesday.\n\nIn addition to not getting paid a fair wage and being deprived of basic rights, the doctors Cuba sends abroad are often forced to work in extremely dangerous conditions, going where local doctors are often either not allowed or won\u2019t go. Kenya is a particularly stark case of this following the disappearance of two Cuban slave doctors last year near the border with Somalia. Kenyan and Cuban authorities believe the two doctors are being held hostage by the jihadist group al-Shabaab, which demanded a ransom the Cuban government presumably has no interest in paying, as the doctors remain missing.\n\nWhile the Cuban slave doctor program has elicited outrage globally for the abuses inflicted on its doctors, in Kenya, local doctors have spent years urging Nairobi to simply hire the large number of domestic doctors looking for work in vain, pushed out of the medical job market by slaves from Cuba. Miami\u2019s Mart\u00ed News reported Wednesday that the Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists, and Dentists Union (KMPDU), which has been at the forefront of advocating for the Kenyan doctors, again issued statements against the government importing another 20 doctors, some specialists, into the country this week.\n\nActing Secretary-General Dr. Chibanzi Mwachonda of the KMPDU issued statements calling the arrival of the 20 Cuban doctors this week \u201cin bad taste,\u201d according to Kenya\u2019s the Standard.\n\n\u201cThe importation of the Cuban doctors by the government is in bad taste. We have health workers who are qualified and have been trained with the taxpayers\u2019 money but the government is not considering them,\u201d Mwachonda asserted during a regular briefing on the Chinese coronavirus crisis in the country.\n\nIn an interview with Kenya\u2019s KTN News, Mwachonda elaborated, noting that Kenya is currently promoting domestic economic production through incentives for local manufacturers \u2014 a move rendered hypocritical by making it more difficult for Kenyan doctors to find work.\n\n\u201cWe have seen the government to support [sic] local manufacturers for manufacturing PPEs [personal protective equipment], but then how do you not support your own doctors and bring onboard other doctors from other foreign countries?\u201d Mwachonda asked. \u201cPerhaps the government is passing a very strong message to Kenyan doctors that they do not need us and, if they do not need us, then the government needs to come out quite clearly on this, whether they require Kenyan doctors or not \u2014 and if they do not then we should take steps to ensure that we offer services elsewhere.\u201d\n\nKMPDU estimates that 1,000 doctors among its ranks are unemployed and proposed to the government of President Uhuru Kenyatta to hire 50 doctors per county nationwide.\n\nKenyan Health Minister Mutahi Kagwe explained last week that his government believed the newly arriving brigade of 20 Cuban slave doctors was necessary in light of the growing number of coronavirus cases in the country. Kenya has documented 15,601 cases of Chinese coronavirus at press time and only 260 deaths \u2014 a small number given its population of 51 million \u2014 but authorities have expressed concern that the number of known coronavirus cases is far lower than the actual number of affected people, due to a lack of proper testing or a robust healthcare system.\n\n\u201cIt is a small brigade of 20 doctors who have come, specialists in their own area,\u201d Kagwe said of the Cubans. \u201cIt\u2019s just to come and exchange skills with our own doctors \u2026 and they also learn from us.\u201d\n\nKenya initially intended the Cuban slave doctor program to go in one direction: the Cubans come to Kenya and share their service and expertise. Last year, however, Kenyan officials revealed that they found Cuba\u2019s medical education to have significant shortcomings and the Cuban slave doctors to be ill-equipped to treat patients. Cuba offers intentionally substandard medical educations so that it can increase the number of slave doctors at its disposal. To solve the problem, Kenya turned the program into an \u201cexchange\u201d where Kenyan doctors who can competently conduct their work mentor the Cuban arrivals. The mentorship program again triggered the ire of local doctors, who asked why their colleagues remained unemployed.\n\nThe KMPDU has been fighting the latest rounds of Cuban slave doctor imports since 2018, when 100 Cubans arrived in the country.\n\n\u201cKenya has 1,000 doctors who are not employed. They have waited for deployment since May 2017. There are additional specialists who have been waiting for deployment to counties. Is there room for these Drs in Kenya?\u201d Ouma Oluga, Mwachonda\u2019s predecessor, said at the time.\n\nThe KMPDU sued the government to prevent the Cubans from arriving but lost the legal challenge.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/africa/2020/07/23/kenya-imports-cuban-slave-doctors-while-1000-kenyan-doctors-remain-unemployed/", "published": "2020-07-23T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Poll: 80% of Venezuelans Want Trump to Stop Supporting Guaid\u00f3", "text": "A poll published Tuesday revealed that nearly 80 percent of Venezuelans believe President Donald Trump should stop supporting Juan Guaid\u00f3, the legitimate president of the country, after nearly two years of failing to exercise his power.\n\nGuaid\u00f3 became president of Venezuela in January 2019 after socialist dictator Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s last term expired. The National Assembly, the federal legislature, has the power to appoint an interim president when the incumbent fails to vacate or a \u201crupture in the democratic order\u201d occurs, according to the Venezuelan constitution. Guaid\u00f3 was president of the National Assembly when lawmakers chose him.\n\nMaduro has failed to vacate the presidential palace and retains control of the Venezuelan armed forces, meaning Guaid\u00f3 has almost entirely failed to act on his status as president, outside of appointing ambassadors to countries that recognize his legitimacy. The new poll, published this week by survey company Megan\u00e1lisis, seems to indicate exhaustion and a lack of faith that Guaid\u00f3 has used the tremendous goodwill he has built up in the West due to his legal status as president to actually free Veenzuela of its socialist regime.\n\nUntil early 2020, Guaid\u00f3 was a member of the Popular Will party, also a socialist organization and a full member of the Socialist International. The Socialist International has routinely condemned Maduro\u2019s United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) for not fulfilling what it deems to be the social responsibilities of government.\n\nIn its latest survey, taken from July 10 to July 15 nationwide, Megan\u00e1lisis asked respondents if they believed that President Trump, one of the first world leaders to recognize Guaid\u00f3 as president, should stop supporting him and support another politician. Of those asked, 78.8 percent replied Trump should do so.\n\nMEGANALISIS\n\nVenezuela Julio 2020\n\nEstudio CATI del 10 al 15 de Julio 2020 Descarga el resto del fragmento publicado:https://t.co/58MRifyDTY Descarga resumen del fragmento no publicado:https://t.co/D9hgorC5Px\n\n\u2026\u2026 pic.twitter.com/eJ5rwlLqBd \u2014 Meganalisis (@Meganalisis) July 21, 2020\n\nOnly 11 percent of respondents, or about one in ten, said that Trump should continue supporting Guaid\u00f3, while about the same amount said they did not know. Asked more directly about Guaid\u00f3\u2019s character, 83.1 percent of respondents said yes to the question, \u201cdo you think Guaid\u00f3 is a weak politician?\u201d, while only five percent said \u201cno.\u201d\n\nThe extremely negative responses towards Guaid\u00f3 did not appear to mean that Venezuelans were supportive of Maduro, under whose leadership the decline begun by late dictator Hugo Ch\u00e1vez became much more rapid and acute. The survey also asked Venezuelans if they believed that Maduro \u201csatisfied the needs of Venezuelans. About 70 percent answered \u201cno,\u201d while only 15 percent said yes.\n\nA similarly overwhelming majority, 69.3 percent, said they did not trust Maduro\u2019s creation of a new National Electoral Commission to oversee elections during the pandemic \u2013 led by judicial authorities responsible for repressing anti-socialist dissidents and at least one Holocaust denier. Maduro has presided over at least five elections international observers have deemed fraudulent since the former bus driver took over for Ch\u00e1vez.\n\nGuaid\u00f3 received significant support from the Venezuelan people for much of early 2019, following his ascent to the presidency. Much of the attitude in the country towards him changed after he announced on April 30, 2019, that he had convinced the leaders of the armed forces to follow his lead, not Maduro\u2019s, and called for civilians to take the streets against Maduro\u2019s forces. Maduro appeared on television the next day stating that his military leaders had done nothing of the sort and that he would violently repress any protest activity.\n\nThough Guaid\u00f3 appealed continuously to civilians, Maduro appearing on television with his top military leaders and a lack of coherent plan to remove them on Guaid\u00f3\u2019s part resulted in Venezuelans losing hope in the endeavor. Ultimately, Guaid\u00f3 apparently failed to attract the support of any Venezuelan soldiers, save for a small number who defected to Colombia and orchestrated a failed attack on Maduro two months ago.\n\nThroughout his tenure, while leading publicity events like the April 2019 takeover, Guaid\u00f3 has treated the Maduro regime as a legitimate negotiation partner, coming to the table with seemingly arbitrary intermediaries like the nations of Norway and Sweden to attempt to make humanitarian agreements with Maduro. The talks resulted in an agreement in June with the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO), a subsidiary of the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) to allow Chinese coronavirus aid into the country. It is unclear at press time if any of that aid has arrived.\n\nPrior polls from Megan\u00e1lisis this year revealed disillusion with Guaid\u00f3. In May, nearly 90 percent of respondents told the pollster that Guaid\u00f3 was not capable of governing the country; 80 percent said Guaid\u00f3\u2019s opposition had \u201cno credibility.\u201d Perhaps the impetus behind this month\u2019s responses, 86 percent said that Guaid\u00f3 had squandered the resources offered to him by President Trump.\n\nTrump\u2019s last large gesture of support to Guaid\u00f3 occurred in February, when he attended Trump\u2019s State of the Union address as a special guest. Trump acknowledged him from the podium and vowed to support a free, non-socialist Venezuela.\n\nWhile supporting Guaid\u00f3 is also the default position of accepting the legitimacy of the Venezuelan constitution, Trump\u2019s overtures towards Guaid\u00f3 were largely the product of former National Security Advisor John Bolton\u2019s strategy. After his removal from the position in September, Trump stated, \u201cI disagreed with John Bolton on his attitudes on Venezuela. I thought he was way out of line and I think I\u2019ve proven to be right,\u201d without elaborating. In his recently released \u201ctell-all\u201d book, Bolton complained that Trump specifically lacked trust in Guaid\u00f3.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/07/22/poll-80-of-venezuelans-want-trump-to-stop-supporting-guaido/", "published": "2020-07-22T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Caruzo: Arrested for Tweeting and Locked in Rotting Hotels: How Socialist Venezuela Fights the \u2018Colombian\u2019 Virus", "text": "CARACAS \u2013 It has now been four months since the Chinese coronavirus lockdowns began in Venezuela with no apparent end in sight.

The same goes for any opinion regarding the announcement that several of the regime\u2019s figureheads have been \u201cinfected\u201d with coronavirus, including top socialist head honcho Diosdado Cabello. Police arrested a prominent former Chavista public figure for a quote-tweet directed at a socialist politician, wishing him good health so he can someday face justice for his actions.\n\nLarga vida, para que la justicia del hombre llegue antes que la divina\u2026 (+Video) \u00a1\u00daltima hora!

Inter-district transit is banned unless you have the corresponding safe passage documents (always available, of course, through a bribe). Barricades have been placed to enforce these restrictions in certain areas, such as El Valle.\n\nSince he cannot incur the wrath of our new Chinese overlords, Maduro has referred to the coronavirus as the \u201cColombian virus\u201d not once, but twice. Even the website of the People\u2019s Ministry for Health refers to it as such, whilst placing the blame on people who \u201center the country through illegal roads.\u201d No scientist anywhere in the world has produced evidence that the virus originated in Colombia; the earliest documented cases occurred in Wuhan, China.\n\n#EnVideo \ud83d\udcf9 | Presidente y Comandante en Jefe de la FANB, @NicolasMaduro: Estamos cortando las cadenas de transmisi\u00f3n del virus (de Covid-19) colombiano que mand\u00f3 Duque #209AnosDeIndependencia pic.twitter.com/sEdMBf0QOz \u2014 VTV CANAL 8 (@VTVcanal8) July 5, 2020\n\nThe regime\u2019s baseless accusations over the \u201cColombian virus\u201d are a facade meant to deflect any accountability for the obliteration of our healthcare system. A socialist regime can\u2019t be the hero without a villain, just so happens that it\u2019s Colombia\u2019s turn this time around.\n\nThose unlucky enough to test positive for the \u201cColombian virus\u201d are effectively imprisoned in hotels that the socialist regime has arbitrarily seized. Venezuelans returning from abroad also receive this treatment, forced into quarantine shelters that lack even the most basic sanitary and hygiene measures, compared to concentration camps.\n\nOnly the socialist regime elite and the military have access to real healthcare, though even the limping private health sector is facing oxygen shortages. Venezuela once claimed to have access to a Cuban \u201cmiracle cure\u201d \u2013 Interferon, which scientists agree has shown no visible potential to cure coronavirus and may kill users \u2013 but Maduro quietly stopped mentioning it over time. In Venezuela\u2019s real healthcare system, the one normal citizens have to use, friends of doctors are actively seeking ways to smuggle PPE to doctors they know, as the government stopped trying to find enough for its medical workers.\n\nAs\u00ed, en medio del horror\u00edfico hacinamiento; transcurre la sala \u201cUCI\u201d Covid del Hospital de Maracaibo.

Not everyone here can brute force their way out of all of the facets of the ongoing collapse of Venezuelan socialism (such as power, water, food, gasoline, et al) through the use of foreign cash. People need to work because their lives depend on it.\n\nSince the Venezuelan banking institutions have remained closed during these past four months of quarantine, the Venezuelan bolivar (or what\u2019s left of it) has become a sort of digital currency. I personally haven\u2019t seen a bolivar banknote in months beyond a stack of useless 100-bolivar ($0.00042) notes that I have on my desk; almost every cash translation is now done in foreign currency.\n\nThe extreme lockdown measures combined with the somehow worsening economic collapse of the country give Maduro plenty of opportunities to create enemies of the state.\n\n#16Jul \u201cNos mandaron a encerrar como que si es que \u00e9l (Maduro) nos va a mantener\u201d.\n\nEl pa\u00eds llega hoy a los 4 meses de cuarentena y esto es de lo que #HablaLaGente.

Unlike most of the grocery stores on the island, consumers at these stores do not have to adhere to communist rations and can buy all that they can afford \u2014 the catch being that most Cubans do not have access to foreign currency, much less enough of it to pay the exorbitant prices at the new stores.\n\nThe Castro regime\u2019s gross mismanagement of the nation\u2019s agriculture for the past 60 years, beginning with the seizure of private estates from experienced farmers and handing of them over to Fidel Castro\u2019s socialist cronies, has left most residents destitute and scrambling to find protein sources.\n\nOne local news outlet described the national quest for chicken meat an \u201cobsession\u201d that has yielded little results in the past year. Other increasingly rare goods are eggs, cooking oil, bread, any wheat products, and sanitary goods like soap, toothpaste, and detergent \u2014 the latter especially important during a pandemic that requires improved hygiene to combat.\n\nThe Communist Party insists that food shortages are the product of the ongoing and loosely enforced U.S. embargo on Cuba \u2014 leaving many to wonder how it managed to fully stock the new foreign currency stores immediately with no changes to American policy.\n\nThose who do not have access to U.S. dollars, according to the state-run Cuban News Agency (ACN), can pay in blood.\n\nBabal\u00fa Blog translated a report from the independent news site ADN Cuba revealing that a chain of stores in Santiago had opened their doors only to certified blood donors, presumably as a way to restock blood banks given their increased need during the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. The stores offered significant perks compared to general stores, including permission to enter without having to stand in line for hours and permission to buy anything in the store without the ration notebook.\n\n\u201cThree Mercados Ideales stores in Santiago de Cuba are open for the sale of consumer goods to voluntary blood donors as part of an initiative by the Provincial Defense Council and the Phase-2, post-COVID-19 recovery program in the city,\u201d the state news agency revealed.\n\nAn estimated 13,000 Cuban citizens nationwide are eligible to shop in these stores. Cuba\u2019s population is about 11 million.\n\nThe manager of one of the stores said that, for less than 200 pesos (about $7.50), blood donors can buy \u201ccakes, saltines, puddings, instant drink mixes, bottled desserts, marmalade, cooking wine, syrup.\u201d Blood donors also gain access to rare products like yogurt and cheese, but not the most coveted foods: meats.\n\nCuba\u2019s healthcare system, often praised by leftists in the free world, has for decades suffered significant shortages of medicine, medical technology, and adequate medical education for practitioners. Cuba spends most of its efforts on educating doctors to sell abroad as slaves in a scheme international human rights groups have decried as human trafficking. At home, most Cuban citizens have minimal access to adequate health care, a situation presumably exacerbated by the Chinese coronavirus pandemic.\n\nCubans are also more exposed to disease by chronic water shortages, which make showering and washing hands difficult. Residents of one impoverished Havana neighborhood protested in an online video that they had running water in their neighborhood only once every two weeks.\n\nAdd to this situation the fact that Cubans are forced to stand near each other, with minimal social distancing, in ration lines to buy food. Not standing in line for hours can result in forfeiting access to rice or stale bread and starving. To supplement what little the government provides, regime officials have advised eating banana peels and ostrich meat, which is not available in Cuba.\n\nThe communist regime blames the lack of access to food on the Trump administration, claiming that the United States not trading with Cuba prevents the regime from doing business with any other country. Cuban officials have also claimed that the people enjoy food rations, suggesting the policy of hoarding food away from the general population is in place by demand.\n\nCubans on the island have, for decades, received substantial aid from family abroad, money that ultimately goes to the regime through purchases on the island, high processing fees, and other schemes. President Donald Trump moved last month to limit profits from remittances by banning American companies from doing business with a Communist Party corporation that handled much of the money. A U.S. State Department spokesman explicitly stated the policy was meant to limit communist profits from remittances.\n\nCuba appears to have put together its foreign currency stores, debuting on Monday, explicitly to drive demand for remittances, heightening the guilt for Cuban-American loved ones. Photos of the new stores show them clean, fully stocked, and carrying rare items like meat and shampoo \u2014 a stark contrast to the dilapidated, filthy grocery stores most Cubans must patronize.\n\nMientras los mercados de #Cuba para la venta de productos en CUC siguen desabastecidos, el surtido de las estrenadas tiendas en divisas es amplio.https://t.co/SvyGVsDPE7 pic.twitter.com/pSx4iSK5V2 \u2014 Diario de Cuba (@diariodecuba) July 21, 2020\n\nThe independent Cuban outlet 14 y Medio reported extensive lines in front of the new stores Monday and Tuesday, with many desperate Cubans asking if they could find chicken or cooking oil within. Cubans were shocked to find that rations still existed within the fully stocked stores \u2014 \u201cjust because it is a foreign currency store doesn\u2019t mean things aren\u2019t limited,\u201d one security guard said \u2014 and not an ounce of chicken. Products, particularly cooking oil, went fast, though many were too expensive to buy at all. A bottle of white asparagus, for example, went for $68, according to 14 y medio.\n\nMany of the products that disappeared rapidly resurfaced on the black market online, moments after the stores opened. Diario de Cuba reported that it took less than 24 hours for online black market sites to feature shampoo, electric razors, and other non-food products.\n\nDiario de Cuba quoted one Havana resident who expressed shock not just in the poor management of the stores, but in what it means for the average Cuban to see products that had disappeared from shelves for years suddenly resurface overnight.\n\n\u201cFor me the most impressive thing is that many of these things were sold in [Cuban pesos] and started disappearing little by little throughout the years,\u201d the man, identified as Juan David, said. \u201cIt\u2019s as if they had them hidden.\u201d\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2020/07/21/coronavirus-cuban-grocery-offers-food-ration-perks-blood-donors/", "published": "2020-07-21T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Parts of Oil-Rich Venezuela Stop Selling Gasoline to Fight Coronavirus", "text": "Parts of the oil-rich socialist state of Venezuela suspended the sale of gasoline entirely on Monday in what authorities claim is a radical measure aimed at stopping the spread of the Chinese coronavirus.\n\nDeputy to the Legislative Council of the western state of T\u00e1chira (CLET) Nellyver Lugo, a loyalist of the Maduro regime, announced the move, insisting they were taking the unusual measure due to an uptick in coronavirus cases.

Lugo also did not explain how suspending gasoline would prevent the spread of infection, given that purchasing fuel does not generally require large amounts of human contact.\n\nAccording to official figures, the state of T\u00e1chira has recorded 1,250 cases of the virus, which represents approximately ten percent of the country. As of Tuesday, health officials have confirmed 12,334 cases nationwide which, if correct, places Venezuela well below neighboring countries including Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru, even relative to the varying size of their populations.\n\nWidespread skepticism exists about the veracity of these figures for a variety of reasons, including the lack of testing, the decrepit nature of the country\u2019s healthcare system, and the Maduro regime\u2019s tendency to propagate lies and falsehoods to protect its own reputation.\n\nIt is also difficult to verify the real reason behind the suspension, given that Venezuela continues to experience massive fuel shortages forcing motorists to wait hours or even days in order to purchase. Venezuela\u2019s production of crude oil reportedly fell for the sixth consecutive month in June, decreasing by a further 32 percent.\n\nAs a result of this lack of production, which began following Hugo Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s decision to nationalize the country\u2019s oil industry, the regime is now forced to import crude from authoritarian allies such as Russia, China, and Iran.

Those found violating the measures are typically subject to a 950,000 peso ($250) fine, yet there remains widespread disobedience as many living in poverty are forced to go out to work regardless. Quarantine is scheduled to end August 1, and may well be extended again.\n\nThe ongoing operation of terrorist groups nationwide underscores the failure of President Juan Manuel Santos\u2019s peace deal with the FARC to weaken the group. Santos forced through the country\u2019s Congress in 2016 despite its rejection in a nationwide referendum and won the Nobel Peace Prize for it.\n\nUnder the agreement, senior rebel leaders were given amnesty or light prison sentences in return for the group laying down its arms. Yet since the deal was approved, other Marxist groups such as the National Liberation Army have filled the void, carrying out multiple terrorist attacks across the country and continuing to earn their money in the cocaine trade. Senior FARC leaders have also disappeared into the Colombian jungle, calling for more violence.\n\nLike many parts of South America, Colombia is now approaching the peak of the pandemic. As of Thursday, medical authorities have confirmed over 165,000 cases of the virus and 5,814 deaths, with the number of cases rising by an average of 5,000 every day. That places it well behind some of its neighbors including Mexico, Peru, and Chile, all of whom have recorded over 300,000 cases, while Brazil is now rapidly approaching two million.\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/07/16/colombia-marxist-rebel-groups-kill-coronavirus-lockdown-violators/", "published": "2020-07-16T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Uruguay Accused of Engaging in Cuban Slave Doctor Program", "text": "Attorneys with the Global Liberty Alliance, a human rights NGO, filed a complaint with the government of Uruguay on Thursday urging the nation to investigate its deal with communist Cuba to import doctors to the country.\n\nCuba\u2019s \u201cmedical diplomacy,\u201d a system in which it exports hastily educated doctors and other health professionals to work with little to no pay in friendly states, is one of the most important sources of revenue that keeps the Castro regime afloat. Estimates suggest the communist regime generates over $11 billion a year selling slave doctors.\n\nDoctors that have escaped the system \u2014 facing a ban on visiting their loved ones on the island for at least eight years \u2014 say they endured slavery conditions and abuse, filed fraudulent medical information that made them appear more productive than they really were, and were often sent into the most remote and dangerous areas of the countries to which they were sent after being stripped of their passports and told that, in the event of their death, no one would come for their bodies.\n\nAt least two Cuban slave doctors, Landy Rodr\u00edguez Hern\u00e1ndez and Assel Herrera Correa, remain missing in Kenya at press time, presumably abducted by the jihadist group al-Shabaab. The Cuban regime has done little to rescue them.\n\nSome of those who have escaped the slave doctor system are currently suing the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO), the regional subsidiary of the World Health Organization (W.H.O.), in U.S. court for its participation in ensuring the legality of \u201cMais M\u00e9dicos,\u201d the Brazilian wing of the Cuban slave doctor program. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who prompted the cancelation of the deal by asking Cuba to accept that Brazil pay its doctors directly rather than send the money to Havana, accused the entirety of the United Nations of engaging in slavery over the program in a speech to the U.N. General Assembly last year.\n\nThe complaint before Uruguay\u2019s National Institute of Human Rights and Ombudsman Office (INDDHH) filed this week urges that body, which is responsible for overseeing accusations of human rights violations in the country, to investigate the Uruguayan analog to \u201cMais M\u00e9dicos\u201d and cut any ties with the Cuban regime\u2019s slave doctor program if it finds evidence of similar abuse. The complaint is part of a greater effort to \u201cgo local\u201d and challenge every nation that forms the web of patrons keeping the Cuban regime afloat, Jason Poblete, chief counsel and policy adviser for the Global Liberty Alliance, told Breitbart News.\n\n\u201cExposing the Cuban trafficking networks and assisting those who seek to leave these missions is in the U.S. national interest. So is holding to account persons, organizations, and businesses involved in facilitating modern-day slavery of Cuban health workers,\u201d Poblete said. \u201cBy going local, we intend to do just that with legal and human rights teams in Uruguay and other nations.\u201d\n\nThe official complaint, obtained by Breitbart News, argues to the human rights court of Uruguay that no evidence exists that Cuban slave doctors in the country receive a living wage or have basic rights like reasonable work hours and vacation time that they may freely use.\n\n\u201cIt is known publicly that medical and non-medical personnel in these brigades are pressured to participate in said missions and fear reprisal from the Cuban state if they do not participate \u2026 these people do not sign a work contract \u2014 or, if they do, it is a type of contract of adhesion, without being aware of the working terms that they are subjected to,\u201d the complaint reads. \u201cIt remains unknown if [doctors] really receive a salary \u2026 to live a life with dignity; there is no establishment of reasonable work hours; there is no free agreement to a work contract; there is no permission for free circulation or areas of rest [annual vacation]; and these individuals accept these missions under pressure from the Cuban state.\u201d\n\nThe complaint also raises concerns given that doctors\u2019 salaries do not go directly to the individuals\u2019 bank accounts, but instead are deposited in an account run by the Cuban Communist Party. Uruguay, presumably, then trusts the Castro regime to pay doctors fairly, which evidence from neighboring countries suggests they do not.\n\nEven if Cuba did pay its doctors as requested, however, the complaint notes that the official salaries for doctors are well below what is necessary to meet the cost of living in most of Uruguay.\n\n\u201cIn the event of finding evidence regarding the irregularity of the facts relayed here that violate human rights,\u201d the complaint demands, Uruguay should \u201ctake the necessary and sufficient measures to finalize said situation.\u201d\n\nThe complaint is a preliminary step in Uruguay that could result in similar legal actions occurring elsewhere in nations where Cuba profits off of the human trafficking of doctors. It may also embolden doctors in Uruguay to sue the country in the event that an investigation reveals it was complicit in denying the doctors their salaries.\n\nThe lawsuit in U.S. court against the PAHO, in which doctors are directly demanding redress for their unpaid labor, accuses that agency of becoming \u201cthe creator, manager, and enforcer of the enterprise through which Cuba shipped medical professionals to Brazil under conditions constituting human trafficking under international law and U.S. law.\u201d Unlike the situation in Uruguay, the PAHO was officially a signatory to the deal that created \u201cMais M\u00e9dicos,\u201d which allowed Brazil to skirt sanctions on Cuba in paying the government for service.\n\nPressure on PAHO resulted in the organization announcing this week that it would launch an independent probe into \u201cMais M\u00e9dicos,\u201d an announcement welcomed by the U.S. government.\n\n\u201cThe United States and other key PAHO member states have actively worked with PAHO leadership to design this review into how Mais M\u00e9dicos was initiated and operated,\u201d Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cThe review is designed to answer the questions that the U.S. government has raised. The United States will work to protect our partner institutions from any malign attempts to corrupt their true mission, while preserving the interests of the U.S. taxpayer.\u201d\n\nThe timing of these legal actions comes as Cuba attempts to promote its Cuban slave doctor program to help with global response to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. The Communist Party sent dozens of doctors to Italy in March, at the height of the epidemic there, while encouraging European tourism at home.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/07/16/uruguay-latest-nation-face-accusation-engaging-cuban-slave-doctor-program/", "published": "2020-07-16T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Cubans Endure Two Weeks Without Running Water amid Pandemic", "text": "Residents of Havana denounced the Cuban government in a report Tuesday revealing they have often spent as long as two weeks without access to running water in the past three months amid the Chinese coronavirus pandemic.\n\nHavana has been plagued for years with dilapidated infrastructure in residential neighborhoods as well as chronic shortages of food and water. During the pandemic, however, when doctors have said that washing hands often is a key to preventing the spread of the coronavirus, Cubans now say the lack of access to water is as much a health risk as a severe inconvenience, forcing them into other neighborhoods to find wells and carry back buckets of water for toilets, cooking, and to use for baths.\n\n\u201cWe have been in this water situation for almost three months,\u201d Jaqueline Heredia, a resident of central Havana, told the U.S.-based Mart\u00ed News on Tuesday. \u201cThe neighbors have gone to complain to Havana Water \u2026 but they just tell them they will check it out, that there are problems.\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes we spend 15 days without water and we have to carry it from some state place to take baths,\u201d Heredia noted, adding that Communist Party agents insist Cubans maintain proper hygiene to fight the Chinese coronavirus but, \u201cwith what water?\u201d\n\nThe Cubans in Havana who reported to Mart\u00ed that they do receive water do so in spurts of six hours every two weeks, or receive a consistent flow of dirty, smelly water.\n\n\u201cThe water here is coming in black, dark, smelly, as if it came from a hole in the ground,\u201d Robert P\u00e9rez told the outlet.

Prior to the official arrival of the coronavirus in Cuba, the independent news outlet Cubanet detailed water rations throughout the capital coupled with broken pipes clearly wasting water flowing into the streets.\n\n\u201cOne of the most inefficient and unstable services is the administration of water, since over the years, along with government abandon, the deterioration of hydraulic infrastructure has increased dramatically,\u201d Cubanet noted in February.\u201d \u201cTo justify the strict distribution schedule \u2013 five hours on alternate days for most municipalities, except for those \u2018favored\u2019 \u2013 they use drought and population increase as excuses.\u201d\n\nThe author noted that \u201cbaths\u201d using small jars of water had become commonplace in Havana.\n\nCuba\u2019s communist regime first documented coronavirus cases in mid-March, identifying them as Italian tourists. The Castro regime\u2019s initial response to the pandemic was to increase tourism advertising, attempting to stay open to foreigners and attract tourists whose vacations elsewhere had been canceled. Cuba eventually shut its borders \u2014 for which it received praise from far-left media outlets in the United States \u2014 after Cuban citizens took to the streets to protest, attracting international attention.\n\nTo solve the water crisis, Cuba kept its schools open and demanded that parents send children to school with their own soap and water. Soap is as difficult as water, or perhaps more so, to procure for the average Cuba. By the end of March, authorities in Havana had promised that running water would enter homes once every three days, a promise they have apparently failed to keep.\n\nDespite the heightened need for water to help Cubans protect themselves from coronavirus infection, Cuban communist officials imposed fines of up to 3,000 Cuban pesos for people found guilty of \u201cwasting\u201d water. A doctor in Cuba earns, thanks to a newly announced raise, 1,460 Cuban pesos per month.\n\nAccess to water for washing hands is particularly important given Cuba\u2019s ongoing food shortages, also a product of its socialist economy \u2013 the government owns and runs all farmland, imprisoning or exiling the nation\u2019s experienced farmers and herders six decades ago. The Communist Party has routinely failed in the past two years to secure the necessary supplies of basic goods like milk and wheat to feed the nation.\n\nTo procure food \u2014 often rotted chicken meat or vegetables consumed by parasites \u2014 Cubans must wait on long, densely organized lines for hours on end. Here, their proximity to each other, especially in light of many not wearing masks or being forced to make masks out of available clothing, exposes them to high risk of infection. Not waiting on the line could result in not having food to eat.\n\n\u201cThe production of food is a national security issue. Cuba attends to the production of rice and pork meat in a differentiated way in the current national situation,\u201d Gustavo Rodr\u00edguez Rollero, the nation\u2019s minister of agriculture, said this week, comments Cubanet noted were bizarre given that pork and domestically produce rice have been missing from ration distribution centers in Cuba for months.\n\nAt press time, the communist regime \u2014 known for fabricating medical statistics \u2014 claims to have documented 2,432 cases of Chinese coronavirus and 87 deaths.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2020/07/15/cubans-endure-two-weeks-without-running-water-amid-pandemic/", "published": "2020-07-15T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Donald Trump Celebrates Success Against \u2018Death Cult\u2019 MS-13", "text": "President Donald Trump celebrated the Department of Justice\u2019s (DOJ) success against MS-13 gangs on Wednesday at the White House.\n\n\u201cWe will not allow these animals to terrorize our communities and my administration will not rest until every member of MS-13 is brought to justice,\u201d Trump said during an Oval Office event on Wednesday.\n\nAttorney General Bill Barr briefed Trump on the success against MS-13 and other gangs in the United States as a result of federal Joint Task Force Vulcan.

Castro regime policies at the time encouraged Cubans to build makeshift marine vessels and flee to the United States, causing an untold number \u2013 believed to be thousands \u2013 of drownings at sea. Many bodies have never been found, believed to be eaten by sharks.\n\nIn the early morning hours of July 13, 1994, 72 people boarded the March 13 and attempted to steer it towards the United States. They did not get past Cuban sovereign waters before government agents surrounded them. Rather than attempt to apprehend the would-be refugees, Cuban agents began sinking the tugboat. Survivors of the killing say that those on board immediately conveyed their intention to return to see when they realized the Castro regime was trying to drown them, desperately shouting at agents that they had young children on board and wished to save them. The families were entirely ignored and agents did not stop until the boat had sunk and most of those on board had died. The Castro regime refused to conduct search operations to find the bodies of those killed; they have never been recovered.\n\nAmong those drowned with pressurized water hoses on the March 13 were 11 children. The youngest, Hellen Mar\u00ednez Enriquez, was five months old. Two-year-old Xicdy Rodr\u00edguez Fern\u00e1ndez was the second-youngest victim. The oldest victim was 56.\n\nThe Castro regime justified the killings by insisting that the boat was \u201cstolen\u201d and calling the victims \u201cunscrupulous\u201d for trying to escape communism.\n\nPrior to 2016, Cubans were considered legally present in America if they touched land, a policy known as \u201cwet foot, dry foot.\u201d President Barack Obama, as part of a series of reforms friendly to the Castro regime, overturned \u201cwet foot, dry foot,\u201d necessitating the deportation of Cuban refugees who reach the United States. As the process of overturning the longstanding policy took time, it resulted in a surge of dangerous treks to the United States by Cubans desperate to arrive before Obama shut the door on them. In an incident reminiscent of the March 13 massacre, Cuban officials sank a boat carrying 32 would-be refugees, including an eight-year-old, attempting to reach the United States in 2014.\n\n\u201cWe were screaming and crying for help as the boat was sinking \u2026 Some people dove in the water and others stayed aboard as the boat sank,\u201d a survivor of the incident said at the time. \u201cThey knew there were children aboard, but continued to charge against us. They didn\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nThe government of Cuba has faced no legal repercussions for its attacks on civilians.\n\nThe participants in Monday\u2019s event told Cuban-American media that they felt the vigil was necessary to honor to dead and remind the world of the horrors of communism.\n\n\u201cI am here because we cannot forget that, on a day like today 26 years ago, 37 Cubans were drowned at sea, among them 11 children,\u201d one woman told Radio Viva 24, adding that they wished \u201cto lift our voices for Cuban prisoners of conscience\u201d who are still alive, as well.\n\n\u201cThe Castro regime are murderers who have destroyed our country for the last 60 years \u2026 abusing our population,\u201d another man participating in the event said.\n\nIn addition to the extended moment of silence, the event featured remarks by Pastor Mario F\u00e9lix Lleonart Barroso to honor the dead.\n\n\u201cThe crime will not remain unpunished before the celestial tribunal, where all is known, where all is seen and where all are held to account,\u201d Pastor Lleonart said, according to the U.S.-based Mart\u00ed News. In prayer, the pastor asked God for \u201cjustice on earth, in human courts and an and to this dictatorship.\u201d\n\nJohn Suarez, the head of the Center for a Free Cuba and organizer of Monday\u2019s event, noted in a statement on the vigil that he intended it also to be in honor of the killing of the head of Cuba\u2019s Christian Liberation Movement, Oswaldo Pay\u00e1 and fellow dissident Harold Cepero, forced off the road and to their deaths by Castro regime agents in 2012. Pay\u00e1 had been working to organize a referendum on the nation\u2019s leadership. Their killings occurred on July 22.\n\nSuarez also noted that Liu Xiaobo, the celebrated Chinese dissident who Beijing refused to allow to collect his Nobel Peace Prize in person in 2010, died on July 13, 2017, and honored him, as well. Liu allegedly died of \u201cmultiple organ failure\u201d after being diagnosed with late-stage cancer that year \u2013 after nearly a decade in prison for openly criticizing Chinese communism. Liu was formally convicted of \u201cincitement to subvert state power\u201d for publicly favoring constitutional democracy to communism.\n\nRadio Free Asia reported on Monday that dictator Xi Jinping had heightened repression in the years since Liu\u2019s death, both within China and in Hong Kong, where it recently banned all speech considered a threat to the Communist Party\u2019s \u201cnational security.\u201d\n\n\u201cFear is being cultivated both in China and in Cuba by the secret police to perpetuate their respective totalitarian regimes, and they are using the internet to do it,\u201d Suarez wrote in anticipation of this week\u2019s vigil. \u201cWe must combat the effort to erase the past with actions that observe these anniversaries.\u201d", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2020/07/14/activists-hold-vigil-for-victims-of-1994-cuban-mass-drowning-including-infant/", "published": "2020-07-14T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Report: \u2018Ellen DeGeneres Show\u2019 Producers Say \u2018It Would Break a Lot of Hearts\u2019 to Stop Production over Hostile Workplace Claims", "text": "Staffers from The Ellen DeGeneres Show held a tense meeting to clear the air and find a way forward after the show found itself in crisis over allegations of an extremely toxic work environment, that Degeneres allegedly helped foment.\n\nIn recent weeks, former employees of the hit daytime talk show have described a toxic work environment of bullying, sexual misconduct, and even racism, with some alleging that DeGeneres was personally responsible for the chaotic culture.

Over recent years, a large number of Democrats, most notably Hillary Clinton, have demanded it be abolished in favor of a national popular vote.\n\nHowever, there are a small number of Republicans who support the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, a system that would maintain the electoral college but elect the president based on the nationwide number of votes cast. Voters are generally split on the issue, and most voters tend to not show concern for the electoral college.\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Parler, Facebook, or Twitter.

Yet according to Muskat, DeGeneres was responsible for the toxic work environment involving racial discrimination and sexual misconduct that has now been alleged.\n\n\u201cI had never seen this before,\u201d Muskat told The Wrap. \u201cI had never been around a toxic host.\u201d Muskat described one incident in which executive producer Ed Glavin screamed at a crew member in front of his colleagues.\n\n\u201cHe just went off on them. His whole face turned red. \u2026 We were stunned. I was waiting for Ellen to say something. \u2018Whoa, Ed, don\u2019t talk like that,'\u201d she recalled. \u201cDo you know what she did? She giggled. She crossed her legs up on the chair and she said, \u2018Well, I guess every production needs their dog\u2019 \u2026 And from then we knew. Ed was going to be the barking dog \u2014 her dog.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could just see everybody\u2019s faces go stiff,\u201d Muskat continued. \u201cWe\u2019re professionals; we\u2019re adults. We don\u2019t need a dog to get us to do our jobs \u2026 She was the only one giggling.\u201d\n\nThe former employees also recounted how Muskat was sidelined after falling out of DeGeneres\u2019s favor, particularly after she refused to hand over her sources. Maskat was eventually let go days before the Daytime Emmy Awards ceremony. Ellen won Outstanding Talk Show based on various segments Muskat had produced.\n\nShe explained:\n\nOne day I get called into the office. Ed says to me, \u2018You know, Hedda, we\u2019re really loving your segments. I don\u2019t know how you do it. We\u2019re going to need all your sources.\u2019 \u2026 I\u2019ve worked for 18 years to build those sources. Those sources are why you hired me. From that day on, I felt a turn, that I was really on everybody\u2019s shitlist. They call me in and Ed says, \u2018Congratulations on the nomination. We really appreciate what you\u2019ve done, but we no longer need your services.\u2019 \u2026 I could have easily done that job for the rest of my life. I knew it inside and out.\n\nIn a statement last week after BuzzFeed dropped the allegations against her, DeGeneres apologized to her staff but attempted to shift blame onto others.\n\n\u201cAs we\u2019ve grown exponentially, I\u2019ve not been able to stay on top of everything and relied on others to do their jobs as they knew I\u2019d want them done,\u201d she wrote. \u201cClearly some didn\u2019t. That will now change and I\u2019m committed to ensuring this does not happen again.\u201d\n\nLast week, The Daily Mail quoted a Telepictures insider as saying that the 62-year old was considering quitting the show over concerns her brand would never recover. However, the rumors were dismissed by Andy Lassner, who told his social media followers that \u201cnothing is going off the air.\u201d\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Parler, Facebook, or Twitter.

He was 85.\n\nBrimley\u2019s manager Lynda Bensky said the actor died Saturday morning in a Utah hospital. He was on dialysis and had several medical ailments, she said.\n\nThe mustached Brimley was a familiar face for a number of roles, often playing characters like his grizzled baseball manager in \u201cThe Natural\u201d opposite Robert Redford\u2019s bad-luck phenomenon. He also worked with Redford in \u201cBrubaker\u201d and \u201cThe Electric Horseman.\u201d\n\nBrimley\u2019s best-known work was in \u201cCocoon,\u201d in which he was part of a group of seniors who discover an alien pod that rejuvenates them. The 1985 Ron Howard film won two Oscars, including a supporting actor honor for Don Ameche.\n\nBrimley also starred in \u201cCocoon: The Return,\u201d a 1988 sequel.\n\nFor years he was pitchman for Quaker Oats and in recent years appeared in a series of diabetes spots that turned him at one point into a social media sensation.\n\n\u201cWilford Brimley was a man you could trust,\u201d Bensky said in a statement. \u201cHe said what he meant and he meant what he said. He had a tough exterior and a tender heart. I\u2019m sad that I will no longer get to hear my friend\u2019s wonderful stories. He was one of a kind.\u201d\n\nBarbara Hershey, who met Brimley on 1995\u2032s \u201cLast of the Dogmen,\u201d called him \u201ca wonderful man and actor. \u2026 He always made me laugh.\u201d\n\nThough never nominated for an Oscar or Emmy Award, Brimley amassed an impressive list of credits. In 1993\u2019s John Grisham adaptation \u201cThe Firm,\u201d Brimley starred opposite Tom Cruise as a tough-nosed investigator who deployed ruthless tactics to keep his law firm\u2019s secrets safe.\n\nJohn Woo, who directed Brimley as Uncle Douvee in 1993\u2032s \u201cHard Target,\u201d told The Hollywood Reporter in 2018 that the part was \u201cthe main great thing from the film. I was overjoyed making those scenes and especially working with Wilford Brimley.\u201d\n\nA Utah native who grew up around horses, Brimley spent two decades traveling around the West and working at ranches and race tracks. He drifted into movie work during the 1960s, riding in such films as \u201cTrue Grit,\u201d and appearing in TV series such as \u201cGunsmoke.\u201d\n\nHe forged a friendship with Robert Duvall, who encouraged him to seek more prominent acting roles, according to a biography prepared by Turner Classic Movies.\n\nBrimley, who never trained as an actor, saw his career take off after he won an important role as a nuclear power plant engineer in \u201cThe China Syndrome.\u201d\n\n\u201cTraining? I\u2019ve never been to acting classes, but I\u2019ve had 50 years of training,\u201d he said in a 1984 Associated Press interview. \u201cMy years as an extra were good background for learning about camera techniques and so forth. I was lucky to have had that experience; a lot of newcomers don\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cBasically my method is to be honest,\u201d Brimley said told AP. \u201cThe camera photographs the truth \u2014 not what I want it to see, but what it sees. The truth.\u201d\n\nBrimley had a recurring role as a blacksmith on \u201cThe Waltons\u201d and the 1980s prime-time series \u201cOur House.\u201d\n\nAnother side of the actor was his love of jazz. As a vocalist, he made albums including \u201cThis Time the Dream\u2019s On Me\u201d and \u201cWilford Brimley with the Jeff Hamilton Trio.\u201d\n\nIn 1998, he opposed an Arizona referendum to ban cockfighting, saying that he was \u201ctrying to protect a lifestyle of freedom and choice for my grandchildren.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, Brimley\u2019s pitchwork for Liberty Mutual had turned him into an internet sensation for his drawn out pronunciation of diabetes as \u201cdiabeetus.\u201d He owned the pronunciation in a tweet that drew hundreds of thousands of likes earlier this year.\n\nBrimley is survived by his wife Beverly and three sons.", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2020/08/02/wilford-brimley-cocoon-star-face-of-quaker-oats-commercials-dies-at-85/", "published": "2020-08-02T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Nolte: My Trip to the Drive-In During a Pandemic \u2014 We Saw \u2018Iron Man!\u2019", "text": "I\u2019ve written more than once about the handful of years \u2014 the first years of our marriage (1989 to 1993) \u2014 when my wife and I pretty much spent every summer Friday night at the drive-in movies. Those articles are filled with nostalgia and longing and sentiment and all the other emotions you feel as your past becomes the long past.\n\nIt\u2019s been almost 30 years since we\u2019ve gone to the drive-in. Thirty. That\u2019s a long time to be away from something you love\u2026\n\nWell, that losing streak finally ended two weeks ago \u2026 and completely by accident.\n\nMy wife and I have just returned from a two week camping trip. I didn\u2019t publicize the trip while we were away. In a world where the corporate media and Democrats actively and openly encourage their Antifa and Black Lives Matter Brownshirts to commit acts of violence, advertising my empty house did not seem like the smartest way to go.\n\nIt was a blissful two week trip. We visited George Washington\u2019s home at Mt. Vernon and spent two full days exploring Gettysburg. Because of my wife\u2019s health issues, we took our time so she would have plenty of days to rest, and that ended up being a perfect way to travel. Instead of rushing around trying to see everything, we had at least six full days of nothing to do but hang around the RV park \u2014 idyllic days filled with grilled hamburgers, a good book, and long walks with the dogs.\n\nThese leisurely days allowed me to stumble on two things we weren\u2019t looking for. The first was the home of the great Civil War Confederate general, Thomas Jonathan \u201cStonewall\u201d Jackson, which was closed due to the coronavirus. The small estate was open, though, so I walked the grounds. The small museum was also open, and that\u2019s where I purchased the Jackson biography Rebel Yell, an addictive and exciting read that exposes the bigotry and ignorance of those demanding the removal of Confederate monuments.\n\nThe second thing I stumbled on was an operational drive-in movie theater just a mile from one of our camps. A genuine, old-fashioned drive-in with crunching gravel, greasy French fries, and window speakers\u2026\n\nNow, at this point, you might be asking why, with my wife\u2019s health issues, we would venture out on a two week trip in the age of the coronavirus. Why take the chance?\n\nBecause we\u2019re not insane. We\u2019re cautious, not paranoid. To begin with, we spent most of the trip in our own environment \u2014 the truck and camper. That means we ate, slept, and drove everywhere in an environment no one else enters. What\u2019s more, camping is perfect for social distancing. You have at least 40 square feet all to yourself.\n\nSo the only risk were those rare moments we were indoors, so we wore our masks and washed our hands, and enjoyed the fact that there were so few people around.\n\nThese are places my wife and I have always wanted to visit, and now that they are under direct threat by the organized left, we decided now might be a good time. Remember, it is not just the public monuments these fascist freaks are looking to exterminate. Like everything else we hear from the media, the talking point that These monuments belong in a museum or public battlefield is also a lie as there is now a movement to remove Confederate monuments from Gettysburg \u2014 from Gettysburg!\n\nSo we went, and we had a marvelous time, and let me suggest that if you ever visit Gettysburg you skip the expensive bus tour and instead take your own driving tour with these CDs.\n\nAnyway, the drive-in\u2026\n\nAfter nearly 30 years, would I discover that the reality of the drive-in would not live up to my rose-colored memories of the drive-in? Nope. The rose color is real.\n\nOther than walking Pickett\u2019s Charge (an unforgettable experience), our trip to the drive-in was a completely unexpected highlight.\n\nThe place opened at 7 p.m., and per tradition we arrived right away to get the best spot. For the next two hours we listened to fantastic 80s music blaring through those little metal speakers, we ate a deliciously greasy supper of hotdogs, French fries, and nachos, took the dogs for multiple walks, and ate a whole bag of Twizzlers \u2014 you know, the big bag.\n\nAs far as the virus, this place had it down. There was no human contact whatosever. You purchase your tickets online ($20 a carload). You give your name to the masked person at the entrance booth. You purchase food and drink online and receive a text when the order magically appears on a table.\n\nWe were told to park in-between the speaker poles, as opposed to next to one. This assured plenty of distance between cars, and every 20 minutes the 80s music was interrupted by a short announcement reminding us of the rules, which were reasonable. You could even smoke cigarettes in designated areas.\n\nAt 9 p.m. it was dark, and per tradition the bright lights came on for the trailers and other announcements (this allows people to safely return to their cars). Then the bright lights shut off and the movie began\u2026\n\nIron Man (2008), and it was glorious\u2026\n\nObviously, I\u2019ve seen Iron Man more than once, but it\u2019s been a while, and I had forgotten the finer points. What a shock to be reminded of how much Marvel as devolved over the last 12 years. Iron Man is not only incredibly entertaining, it\u2019s unabashedly pro-American, conservative, anti-PC, and even sexy. Can you imagine today\u2019s sterilely-woke Marvel serving up stripper/stewardesses?\n\nThe second feature was Bohemian Rhapsody (2018), which I love, but it was 11:30 and I had to work the next day, so we rolled down the windows and listened to that lovely sound of crunching gravel as we slowly made our way out.\n\nThe drive-in hasn\u2019t changed at all. Which is wonderful. Change sucks.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

Ultimately, it would be in French interests to prevent such departures,\u201d the mass migration sceptic pressure group suggested.\n\nThis sentiment was echoed d by the former head of the Border Force, Tony Smith, who warned this week that if no agreement is reached between the French and British governments, then the number of illegal boat migrants will likely reach a \u201ccrisis\u201d level.\n\nSo far this year, over 3,500 migrants have crossed the Channel by sea illegally, compared to 1,890 for the whole of 2019.

However, the damage he inflicted and the restrictions on public gatherings during the Chinese coronavirus did not stop hundreds from illegally attending his funeral earlier this month.\n\n62 Per Cent of Britons Think Boris Johnson\u2019s Government Is Failing on Immigration https://t.co/ftbRQFGPd9 \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) July 28, 2020\n\nMr Farage has taken it upon himself to document the growing problem of illegal migration in the Channel, claiming that the mainstream media is wrong to overlook the issue and that they are \u201cout of touch\u201d with the British public.\n\nIn May, the arch-Brexiteer filmed an \u201cabsolutely packed\u201d and \u201cmassively overcrowded\u201d small rubber boat in the middle of the English Channel. In his report, Mr Farage accused the French Navy of actively escorting illegal migrant boats into British territorial waters, before handing them over to UK Border Force.\n\nThis claim was backed up by reporting from Breitbart London\u2019s Oliver Lane, who revealed that the French Navy\u2019s own transponder data showed the French not only handed over migrants in Mr Farage\u2019s film but had performed a similar migrant boat handover the week prior.\n\nSo far this year, there have been over 3,285 migrants recorded to have reached British shores by illegally crossing the Channel, with an estimated 14 more boats arriving near Dover on Thursday morning, according to the Daily Mail.\n\nSeveral of the migrants were pictured taking selfies as they sunned themselves on the beach after their arrival.\n\nMigration Watch: 7,500 Illegal Boat Migrants Will Reach the UK by Christmas https://t.co/QwTl0EpcIS \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) July 8, 2020\n\nFollow Kurt on Twitter at @KurtZindulka", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/europe/2020/07/31/nigel-farage-uncovers-hotel-refusing-brits-while-housing-147-migrants/", "published": "2020-07-31T00:00:00"}, {"title": "UK Violent Protests up 1,700 Per Cent in 20 Years", "text": "Violent protests in England and Wales have risen by an astonishing 1,700 per cent over just 20 years, according to research conducted by the Police Foundation.\n\nIn 2019, 126 protests devolved into violent altercations \u2014 compared to just seven in the year 2000 \u2014 resulting in hundreds of police officers being injured and millions of pounds in property damage.\n\nThe violence at protests reached a fevered pitch last month when Black Lives Matter rioters clashed with police in London. Violent scenes were also captured on film by Breitbart London at anti-Brexit and Extinction Rebellion rallies over the past year.\n\nThe report from the Police Foundation, an independent think tank, found that the total number of protests has also steadily risen over the past decade, with 83 organised protests in 2007 compared to 280 last year.\n\n\u201cIn any society, social tensions can erupt posing challenges of public order and a risk of harm. There are signs that such tensions have heightened in recent years in England and Wales,\u201d the report stated.\n\nThe growing social tension in the UK was perhaps best typified by an anti-Brexit protester who wished Prime Minister Boris Johnson a \u201chorrible death\u201d at a protest-turned-riot in December of last year:\n\nThe violence at protests in the UK severely ramped up, however, following the death of George Floyd in America, which saw a resurgent Black Lives Matter UK street movement. In the first three weeks of the BLM protests, at least 140 police officers were injured in the London riots.\n\nIn one famous incident, a police officer was filmed walking away from a BLM protest with blood pouring from his face, as activists chased police, hurled projectiles, and screamed: \u201cRun, piggy, run!\u201d\n\nBlack Lives Matter protests-turned-riots also saw protesters punching police officers outside Downing Street, the headquarters of the British government.\n\nAt a separate BLM protest on June 5th outside Downing Street, a policewoman was thrown from her horse as the vicious mob hurled bicycles at the mounted police.\n\nThe violent scenes at the protest were captured on film by Breitbart London:\n\nThe increasingly disruptive protest movements in the UK have also come with a heavy cost to the British taxpayer.\n\nLast year, the eco-warrior activist group, Extinction Rebellion (XR), cost the Metropolitan Police at least \u00a337 million, with \u00a321 million spent during the so-called the group\u2019s \u2018Autumn Rising\u2019.\n\nThe far-left group staged large-scale sit-ins on the city\u2019s roads in London, glued themselves to the London Stock Exchange\u2019s doors, the headquarters of Shell Oil, as well as to cars, lorries, and to supposedly \u2018green\u2019 public transport vehicles.\n\nThe two-week-long protest in the autumn of 2019 saw the climate alarmist group attempt to shut down the British capital city in protest against the so-called climate crisis XR believes is imminent.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Dame Cressida Dick, said that chaos caused by Extinction Rebellion activists put a severe strain on police resources in London, which has been grappling with a crime wave under the leadership of Mayor Sadiq Khan.\n\nThe cost of policing the group was nearly double the total budget of the city\u2019s Violent Crime Taskforce, which is only \u00a315 million.\n\nIn February, a student-led \u201cClimate Strike\u201d protest in London saw Antifa and Extinction Rebellion violently clash with police, and attempt to shut down Westminster Bridge. At least three activists were arrested during the demonstration, which was caught on film here:\n\nDespite the growing unrest, London Mayor Sadiq Khan has announced that he is planning to cut some \u00a3110 million from the budgets of the Metropolitan Police, the Mayor\u2019s Office for Policing and Crime (MOPAC), and the fire brigade, among other public bodies.\n\nThe report from the Police Foundation warned that the growing number of protests have strained the resources of police forces.\n\nSir Michael Barber, the Chairman of the Strategic Review of Policing, said per The Telegraph: \u201cFor some time now policing has been wrestling with a tension between the rise of more complex crimes and social challenges and an operating model that was built for a different time.\n\n\u201cWhereas in the past the police could deal relatively straightforwardly with bringing offenders to justice they are now presented with a variety of problems, many of which require a social rather than a criminal justice solution and most of which cannot be tackled by a single agency but require extensive collaboration.\u201d\n\nWATCH: BLM Activist Calls for Revolution in the UK, Saying: \u2018The Police Is No Different from the KKK\u2019 https://t.co/20iuJbgTQ4 pic.twitter.com/ZR4R1fEU6z \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) July 13, 2020\n\nFollow Kurt on Twitter @KurtZindulka", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/europe/2020/07/29/uk-violent-protests-up-1700-per-cent-in-20-years/", "published": "2020-07-29T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Lampedusa Runs out of Room to Quarantine Arriving Migrants", "text": "ROME (AP) \u2014 Several small boats filled with more Tunisian migrants have reached a tiny Italian island that has run out of room to quarantine them as required by Italy\u2019s anti-coronavirus measures, local officials said Saturday.\n\nSicilian daily newspaper Giornale di Sicilia quoted Lampedusa Mayor Toto\u2019 Martello as saying the island can\u2019t wait until the government sends a chartered ferry where the migrants can be held for 14 days to fulfil the country\u2019s quarantine requirement.\n\nThe island\u2019s migrant holding centre was built for a maximum capacity of 95 people and was already holding 950 when the latest passengers arrived, Martello said.

To kickstart its stalled economy, Spaniards were encouraged to cautiously resume their lives under a \u201cnew normality\u201d based on wearing face masks, washing hands and social distancing.\n\nThe respite didn\u2019t last long.\n\nOutbreaks among farmworkers and young people desperate to resume socialising after being cooped up have spread across northern Spain, spawning what some health officials fear could be the start of a dreaded \u201csecond wave\u201d of infections.\n\n\u201cIt pains me to think that we could be right back where we were,\u201d Gaya said after getting tested for coronavirus at her local health clinic in Sant Sadurni D\u2019Anoia, a village near Barcelona. She came in because she had a fever, one of the typical symptoms of Covid-19, along with a dry cough and the loss of a sense of smell.\n\n\u201cI think we had done things well. Now I don\u2019t know if we are doing it well at all. I\u2019m not sure at what point we are safe,\u201d Gaya said.\n\nOn June 22, the day after Spain ended a national state of emergency and restored free movement around the country, the health ministry registered 125 new cases in 24 hours. Six weeks later, the daily count has jumped, hitting 1,525 on Friday.\n\nSpain is leading Western Europe\u2019s major countries with an average of 60 coronavirus cases per 100,000 inhabitants. While the country\u2019s south and the Canary and Balearic Islands remain in good shape, the regions of Navarra, Arag\u00f3n, and Catalonia have registered more than 120 cases per 100,000 inhabitants over a 14-day period, making Spain\u2019s northeast the biggest European hot spot along with parts of Romania, according to the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control.\n\nIn contrast to the darkest weeks of March and April, when the virus ripped through Spain\u2019s elderly in nursing homes and pushed the country\u2019s hospitals to the breaking point, the pressure is now on Spain\u2019s neighbourhood health clinics. They are trying to screen and isolate the new infections, which are taking place mostly among the young, who in Spain and countries across the world are ignoring social distancing, and the middle-aged.\n\nThe average age of a virus patient in Spain has fallen from 63 in the spring to 45 now and \u201cthe pressure on the health system is low,\u201d said Spanish Health Minister Salvador Illa. Since the virus takes a heavier toll on the elderly, younger coronavirus patients means more who have milder symptoms.\n\nSpain\u2019s improved testing capacity makes a comparison to the start of the pandemic difficult. In February, March and April, a shortage of tests meant that only the very sick who were admitted to hospitals were tested and that a significant number of coronavirus cases went undetected.\n\nNow, local clinics are discovering many more infections among those who don\u00b4t show symptoms.\n\n\u201cWe are in a different situation (than the spring) because right now we have tests available,\u201d said Dr Miriam Ce\u00f1a, director of the health clinics in Sant Sadurni D\u00b4Anoia, which is seeing a jump in cases like the area around Barcelona, Catalonia\u00b4s largest city.\n\n\u201cWe are in a situation of risk and alert. We don\u00b4t want to alarm the population, but we want the population to be responsible,\u201d Ce\u00f1a said. \u201cIn March, there was the lockdown so the situation was under more control. Right now, there is free movement and socializing and those are a risk of contagion.\u201d\n\nThe surge in new infections is sure to add to the drastic contraction of Spain\u2019s economy by slamming hopes of reactivating the country\u2019s critical tourism sector. The economy has already dropped 18% in the second quarter \u2013 its biggest dip since Spain\u2019s 1936-39 Civil War.\n\nBritain has placed a 14-day quarantine on travellers returning from Spain, while France, Germany, and Belgium have all issued travel warnings or discouraged trips to northeast Spain.\n\nAuthorities have for several weeks warned about the danger of new outbreaks, but experts predicted they would likely occur in the colder months. Instead, the surge has come in mid-summer, when Spaniards are eager to reconnect with family and friends, and hotels, restaurants and shops are counting on both domestic and foreign tourists to cushion the pandemic\u2019s blow to their balance sheets.\n\nSpain must now pull off the delicate balancing act of managing the health crisis while reactivating its economy. Officials desperately hope they can avoid another full lockdown that would be catastrophic to businesses and jobs despite the expected injection of massive aid from the European Union.\n\nCatalonia and many other regions have reintroduced restrictions, making masks obligatory at all times outside the home and reclosing nightclubs due to their links to outbreaks.\n\n\u201cWe must be obsessive about complying with the protection measures,\u201d said Catalonia\u2019s public health director, Josep Argimon.\n\nCatalonia, however, is only now deploying 600 workers to its clinics to help nurses and doctors handle the demands of contact tracing, which has been insufficient so far. That lack of urgency has drawn strong criticism from health workers and mayors.\n\nSpain\u2019s government is rolling out a phone app to help contract tracers find and stamp out new infections, while making a renewed appeal for individuals to act responsibly.\n\n\u201cThere are many citizens who feel anguish upon seeing the outbreaks that are happening in different parts of our country,\u201d Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez said Friday. \u201cBecause we have all had to make an enormous effort to be disciplined, show resistance and muster the will to defeat the virus.\u201d\n\n___\n\nWilson reported from Barcelona.", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/europe/2020/08/03/spain-average-virus-patient-age-drops-45-amid-possible-second-wave/", "published": "2020-08-03T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Ex-Border Force Boss: Turn Migrant BoatsBack to France or Face 'Crisis'", "text": "The former chief of the British Border Force has warned the country will face a \u201ccrisis\u201d level of illegal migrant crossings of the English Channel if Britain and France fail to come to an agreement to have boat migrants immediately returned to France.\n\nThe former head of UK Border Force, Tony Smith, said asylum seekers attempting to come to the United Kingdom from France must apply for asylum on the French side of the English Channel, and that the two governments need to sign a treaty that would see boat migrants brought back to France rather than onto British shores.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m advocating is that we need to try as best we can to replicate the juxtaposed controls for legitimate applicants in the same way as for illegitimate applicants,\u201d Smith told the Daily Mail.\n\n\u201cIf they want to come to the UK they need to make their case on the French side, and if they are found in the waterways or even make it as far as Dover we say \u2018I\u2019m sorry but you go back there and that\u2019s where you will be interviewed and processed, on the French side\u2019,\u201d he added.\n\nMr Smith said that he was unsure if Priti Patel\u2019s Home Office will be able to \u201cmake the breakthrough\u201d with France, but did note that the British government has come to agreements with the French in the past.\n\n\u201cI think there are potentially opportunities but there will have to be some kind of a quid pro quo which would satisfy the French that this was a measure that was designed to help both parties, not just a one-way street where the UK essentially is able to blockade anybody coming over from France,\u201d the former Border Force chief said.\n\nThe London-based think tank Migration Watch UK projected that if the current trend continues an estimated 7,500 illegal boat migrants will reach Britain by Christmas.\n\nNew Daily Record for Illegal Channel Crossings as 202 Migrants Reach England https://t.co/8tajOoTgeB \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) July 31, 2020\n\nThe call from Tony Smith backs up similar statements from the former Prime Minister of Australia, Tony Abbott, who was able to successfully halt illegal boat migration from Asia with his Operation Sovereign Borders policy seven years ago.

Some passengers disembarked along the route and may have spread the virus to their local communities.\n\nThe municipality of Tromsoe is urging anyone who traveled on the ship or had any contact with the ship to get in touch with health authorities. A total of 69 municipalities in Norway have been affected, Norwegian news agency NTB reported.\n\nIts not known how the outbreak began since guests come from all over the world. NTB said 33 of the 36 crew members that have tested positive came from the Philippines and the others came from Norway, France and Germany.\n\nOver the weekend, Skjeldam said cruise ship officials did not know that they should have notified the passengers after the first case was reported Friday, adding that they followed the advice of the ship\u00b4s doctors.\n\nBut Line Vold of the Norwegian Institute of Public Health said its advice was to inform passengers and crew as soon as possible so they could monitor their health and go into quarantine if needed.\n\n\u201cWe have made mistakes.

It added cruises to Svalbard in July, Norwegian media reported.\n\nIn Italy, the Costa Crociere cruise ship line said Sunday three crew members from two ships in Civitavecchia, near Rome, have tested positive for the coronavirus. The cruise company said two assigned to the Costa Deliziosa were hospitalized in good condition, and a third, assigned to the Costa Favolosa, was in isolation on the ship.\n\nThe Italian cruise company, which is part of Carnival Corp. said the crews of both ships were being screened `\u00b4in view of the possible relaunch of our cruises, as soon as the government gives the authorization.\u00b4\u00b4 The Cabinet is meeting on the matter next Sunday.\n\nCosta Crociere said that all crew members were tested for the virus before leaving their countries, then undergo a second test once they arrive in Italy, after which they are put under a two-week monitoring period.\n\nCruise lines stopped sailing in mid-March after several high-profile coronavirus outbreaks at sea. More than 710 people fell ill aboard Carnival\u2019s Diamond Princess cruise ship while it was quarantined off Japan and 13 people died.\n\nA German cruise ship last week set sail from Hamburg, testing procedures for how cruise ships can operate safely during the pandemic.

In a sign of the extreme levels of uncertainty around jobs numbers in the pandemic era, economists surveyed by Dow Jones forecast a 1 million jobs gain.\n\nThe economic disruption from the coronavirus has made it far more difficult to measure or predict changes in the U.S. labor market. ADP\u2019s recent numbers have been off by millions when compared with the Labor Department\u2019s monthly report on the employment situation.

You have second-degree murder, heat of passion, but if you keep moving down the line, you have manslaughter [and] involuntary manslaughter.\u201d\n\nAcho continued\n\n\u201cWhile it is not the same thing as first-degree murder, it\u2019s still an unlawful act that kills someone. In the same breath, there are degrees of racism. While we might not have first-degree racism, anymore, we still have third degree racism, which I draw the parallel to involuntary manslaughter. You\u2019re not physically killing them, you may be emotionally killing them.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo your children may just end up committing involuntary racism if you don\u2019t educate them as to the legalities \u2014 so to speak, if I can continue with my analogy \u2014 the legality, so to speak, of racism, and that is why it\u2019s best to educate and to expose them to that,\u201d the NFL player said.\n\n\u201cI think you do have first-degree racism, still [in America].

It was reportedly sailing under a Moldovan flag with a mostly Ukrainian crew at the time.\n\nOther sources report the ship sailed from Georgia (in eastern Europe) and was bound for Mozambique when it docked in Beirut.\n\nThe onetime captain of the Rhosus, Boris Prokoshev, confirmed to RFE that his former ship was the likely source of the confiscated fertilizer cargo.\n\nProkoshev said he and the crew ended up stranded in Lebanon because Grechuskhkin stopped paying their salaries or fees for operating the ship, which evidently prompted Lebanese officials to seize the cargo. The former captain strongly criticized the Lebanese government for failing to take proper safety measures for the dangerous fertilizer and for leaving it to rot in storage long after Grechushkin lost interest in his seized cargo.\n\nAs for the fire that detonated the six-year-old stash of ammonium nitrate, Lebanese media reported on Wednesday that welders working to repair a breach in the walls of the warehouse might have inadvertently sparked the blaze. The precise cause of the smaller detonations visible in the burning port district before the apocalyptic blast that horrified the world is still under investigation.\n\nThe Crimean Maritime Bulletin on Wednesday confirmed the details about MV Rhosus and its cargo, elaborating that Lebanese officials impounded the ship because it failed safety inspections and prevented the crew from returning home because they were afraid they would be \u201cleft with an abandoned vessel on their hands, loaded with dangerous cargo,\u201d a fear that evidently came true.\n\nThe Maritime Bulletin\u2019s sources expressed some confusion as to why the Lebanese government did not seize the vessel and man it with a temporary crew. The ultimate fate of the ship was uncertain as of Wednesday morning, as some eyewitnesses claim to have seen a burning ship in the Beirut harbor on Tuesday that might have been the Rhosus, but former captain Prokoshev said it eventually sailed out of Beirut and sank years ago due to poor maintenance.\n\nReuters quoted sources at the Port of Beirut on Wednesday who blamed sheer \u201cnegligence\u201d for leaving the ammonium nitrate stored unsafely in a warehouse for six years, despite prescient warnings it could \u201cblow up all of Beirut\u201d if it should ever catch on fire. In the event, the explosion on Tuesday was not only powerful enough to severely damage the Port of Beirut and the entire city, it actually changed the coastline.\n\nThe general manager of the port and Lebanon\u2019s customs director both said the cargo was kept at the warehouse under a court order despite requests for it to be \u201cre-exported\u201d and a general understanding that the substance was dangerous.\n\n\u201cWe requested that it be re-exported but that did not happen. We leave it to the experts and those concerned to determine why,\u201d customs director Badri Daher told local media, pointing the first of what is certain to be many fingers as Lebanon\u2019s unsteady government attempts to distribute blame for the incident.\n\nReuters discovered four documented requests for re-export of the material on the grounds that its presence endangered the safety of the port, one filed each year between 2015 and 2017.\n\nThe Siberian Times on Wednesday published photos from 2014 showing crew aboard the Rhosus using signs to plead with Lebanese authorities to let them go home. The article said Igor Grechushkin declared bankruptcy soon after the Rhosus was seized and currently lives in Cyprus with his wife, while their son attends a university in Scotland. Grechushkin has thus far declined requests to be interviewed about the Beirut explosion.", "link": "https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/08/05/beirut-blast-blamed-on-explosive-cargo-seized-from-russian-ship/", "published": "2020-08-05T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Iranian Media: U.S. \u2018Sabotage\u2019 May Have Caused Lebanon Blast", "text": "The Iranian news agency Mehr published an article Wednesday speculating that the deadly explosion that destroyed large parts of Beirut, Lebanon, the day before was the product of U.S. \u201csabotage.\u201d\n\nMehr, the propaganda arm of Iran\u2019s Islamic Ideology Dissemination Organization (IIDO), also gave space on its English-language website to a speculative column asserting, \u201cEven if we accept that the Israelis and the United States were not involved in the Beirut bombing and put aside the possibility of any sabotage plan, they will certainly not ignore this opportunity to seek their political exploitation.\u201d\n\nA giant blast near Beirut\u2019s port incinerated much of the city on Tuesday, leaving a large cloud of red, orange, and purple smoke and resulting in at least 100 deaths, according to the Lebanese Red Cross. Thousands were injured, though tallying a precise number has proved difficult for authorities as several of the city\u2019s clinics and hospitals were damaged in the blast, resulting in bleeding civilians running through town seeking medical help anywhere. Seismologists reported that the blast emulated the power of a 3.5 magnitude earthquake and could be felt nearly 200 miles away.\n\nLebanese authorities announced that preliminary investigations suggested the explosion was the result of the detonation of a cache of nearly 3,000 tons of ammonium nitrate stored with few safety precautions at a warehouse near the port. The color of the smoke plumes appears to corroborate that nitrates were involved. Prime Minister Hassan Diab told reporters the material had been stored there for six years after being confiscated and that the government had no explanation for why no one had bothered to move highly dangerous material from a highly trafficked area.\n\nDespite Lebanese officials denying that they had any evidence of terrorism or intentional detonation \u2014 and no evidence of an airstrike or any aerial activity triggering the blast \u2014 Mehr News proposed that U.S. warplanes may have bombed the harbor.\n\nMehr\u2019s article, \u201cPossibility of U.S. Sabotage in Beirut Explosion,\u201d used unsourced images that appeared to be from a radar system showing various planes in flight near the harbor to make the cases that \u201cunusual\u201d American Navy patrols had occurred on the Lebanon-Syrian coastline at the time of the explosion.

He\u2019s done a good job. It\u2019s hakaras hatov,\u201d using the Hebrew words for gratitude.\n\nKamenetsky, head of the renowned Talmudical Yeshiva of Philadelphia, sits on the rabbinical advisory board of Agudath Israel of America, the ultra-Orthodox world\u2019s leading lobbying and advocacy organization.\n\nThough the majority of American Jews vote for Democrats, the Orthodox Jewish community has increasingly favored Republican candidates in recent years. While, in 2013, a Pew Research Center survey found that 64 percent of ultra-Orthodox Jews considered themselves to be politically conservative; in 2018, 91 percent of Orthodox Jews surveyed by Jewish weekly Ami Magazine gave President Trump favorable ratings \u2014 with 82 percent saying they would support him again in 2020.\n\nFollow Joshua Klein on Twitter @JoshuaKlein.", "link": "https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/08/04/top-american-rabbinical-leader-unequivocally-endorses-trump/", "published": "2020-08-04T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Photos: 'Devastated' Beirut Emerges from the Ashes of Deadly Explosion", "text": "A massive explosion rocked Beirut on Tuesday, flattening much of the city\u2019s port, damaging buildings across the capital, and sending a giant mushroom cloud into the sky.

Current NCC was about $8.8 billion. 10% of that would be stripped away and barred from any law enforcement, legal system use etc. About $3.7 billion in NCC went to those departments this year. \u2014 Bill Melugin (@BillFOXLA) August 4, 2020\n\nThe proposal includes a measure to use racial criteria in determining government funding of businesses, described as \u201caccess to capital for small minority-owned businesses, with a focus on Black-owned businesses.\u201d It also prescribes the use of \u201ccommunity-based restorative justice\u201d among its \u201calternatives to incarceration.\u201d\n\nThe proposal\u2019s section addressing the defunding of law enforcement includes the following language:\n\nEnsure that the ordinance containing the proposed charter amendment is clear that the use of any of these earmarked funds for carceral systems and any law enforcement agencies, including the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department, L.A. County District Attorney\u2019s Office, L.A. County Superior Courts, or L.A. County Probation Department, including redistribution of funds through these agencies, is strictly forbidden.\n\nCity supervisors voting for the proposal are responding to the Black Lives Matter campaign and organization, Streetsblog reported. \u201cReimagine L.A. is one of a number of pushes locally to respond to Black Lives Matter protest demands to defund the police. Metro is taking steps toward shifting resources toward services and away from armed law enforcement. L.A. City and a few smaller cities have some initiatives that would also shift some funding.\u201d\n\nThe initiative was approved by Supervisors Hilda Solis, Sheila Kuehl, Mark Ridley-Thomas, and Janice Hahn.

Although the resolution passed the House on a bipartisan vote, it is unclear if it will receive similar support in the United States Senate.\n\nBiden\u2019s endorsement of the museum also comes as the presumptive nominee seeks to boost his standing among Latino voters ahead of the general election.\n\nSince jumping into the 2020 race, the former vice president has struggled to expand his support among the demographic, especially younger Latinos, many of whom favored Sen.

We have been inextricably linked to this organization that represents our history.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe may not have contributed to the misperception in this case, but we suffer from it and will not allow it to continue,\u201d he said.\n\nThe letter was provided to The Associated Press by a servicemember under the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to do so. Museum officials did not respond to repeated requests for comment from the AP.\n\nThe letter comes one day after a pair of videos of an event at the Fort Pierce, Florida-based museum last year surfaced Sunday on social media.

Others found no issue with the video due to their disagreement with Kaepernick\u2019s protests during the national anthem which they believe are unpatriotic and disrespectful to the memory of fallen service members, a viewpoint shared by President Donald Trump.\n\nKaepernick, 32, began his protests in 2016 and began to kneel during the national anthem after Nate Boyer, a former Army special forces soldier who tried out as a long snapper for the Seattle Seahawks, suggested it. The former San Francisco quarterback and other players faced intense backlash. But a number of athletes have started kneeling after national protests broke out in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s death at the hands of police in Minneapolis in May.\n\nThe video comes to light during a volatile time for Naval Special Warfare Command as it continues to grapple with breakdowns in discipline among their rank-and-file.

In a separate incident, SEALs in a different unit abused cocaine and skirted drug test screenings with clean samples.\n\n\u201cWe own our relationship with the American people and we must honor it,\u201d said Green in his letter on Monday. \u201cWe also own our relationship with each other, and our fellow teammates will all receive the dignity and respect they deserve.\u201d", "link": "https://www.breitbart.com/sports/2020/08/04/navy-seals-cut-ties-with-museum-over-colin-kaepernick-video/", "published": "2020-08-04T00:00:00"}, {"title": "TCU Coach Gary Patterson Apologizes for Using N-Word While Telling Player Not to Use the Word", "text": "Texas Christian University head coach Gary Patterson has apologized for his \u201cunacceptable\u201d use of the n-word, even though he only used it while trying to get a player to stop using the word.\n\nPatterson scolded himself for using the racial slur adding, \u201cI have always encouraged our players to do better and be better, and I must live by the same standards.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, redshirt freshman Dylan Jordan accused the coach of using the word during an argument at a recent practice.\n\nPatterson reportedly began the argument warning Jordan, \u201cYou\u2019re a f**king brat I\u2019ll send you back to Pitt.\u201d Jordan\u2019s hometown is Pittsburgh, Kansas.\n\nIn his tweet about the incident, Jordan added that he retorted, \u201cI ain\u2019t did nothin,\u201d to which coach Patterson reportedly replied, \u201cyou\u2019ve been saying n***as in the meeting room.\u201d\n\nJordan apparently helped organize a boycott of practices until coach Patterson apologized for using the word.\n\n\u201cThis behavior is not okay now or ever, and there needs to be repercussions to these actions,\u201d Jordan exclaimed.\n\nIn his Tuesday, Patterson added, \u201cI met with our Seniors and Leadership Council last night about how we move forward as a team, together.\n\n\u201cWe are committed as individuals and as a program to fighting racial injustice of any kind,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, not all the players backed Jordan\u2019s attempt to blame the coach.

Most of the internally displaced persons (IDPs) seek refuge from violence caused by Boko Haram, a Borno State-based terrorist organization waging an ongoing campaign of jihad throughout northeastern Nigeria.\n\nZulum survived the ambush and said in a press interview on July 30 that he believes the perpetrators were not Boko Haram, as many assumed, but rather soldiers in the Nigerian Army.\n\n\u201cIt is a complete sabotage \u2026 I cannot end my interview without clearly stating what happened yesterday [July 29]. As far as I am concerned, there was no Boko Haram \u2026 It was a serious shooting by the Nigerian Armed Forces while \u2018residing\u2019 in Baga.

Republican and conservative voters are the major exceptions, with 88% of Republican voters and 84% of those identifying as very conservative in politics backing the President\u2019s re-election. The Poll estimates that the shape of the likely electorate in California this fall will clearly favor the Democrats, with 48% of those considered likely to vote being registered Democrats and just 26% registered Republicans. The survey also finds that 13% of the likely voters include those who are newly registered to vote since the last statewide general election. The preferences of these new voters mirror those of the overall electorate, with 67% backing Biden, 25% supporting Trump and 8% undecided.\n\nThese poll results provide indications about the roll California is likely to play in the outcome of the presidential election and the battle for control of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2020.\n\nWhile there is no doubt that California will vote for Joe Biden in 2020, and his current 39 point margin suggests that win in the state will be by more than a 2-to-1 margin, the size of that margin may give a false indication as to the significance of Biden\u2019s current popular vote lead over the president\u2013which, according to the Real Clear Politics Average of Polls, now stands at 7.4 percent\u2013when it comes to the margin that matters in the electoral college vote.\n\nAs our Constitution states, the winner of the presidential election is determined by which candidate receives the majority of electoral college votes cast, which in 2020 will mean at least 270 votes out of the 538 electoral college votes up for grabs.\n\nWhen it comes to the outcome of the presidential election, it seems likely that the popular vote results are likely to be even more skewed from the electoral college results than they were in 2016.\n\nIn 2016, when she won California by 30 points \u2013 4.3 million votes more than Donald Trump \u2013 Hillary Clinton lost the electoral college vote on election day by 306 to 232, despite winning the popular vote by two points, 48 percent to 46 percent. Had Hillary won California by 39 points in 2016, her raw vote margin over Trump would have been 1.2 million more, or 5.5 million, and she would have won the popular votes by four percentage points, 49 percent to 45 percent, but still lost the electoral college vote by the same election day margin of 306 to 232. (Note, due to seven faithless electors, the final electoral college vote was 304 for Trump and 227 for Clinton.)\n\nSince California is one of 48 states that have a winner-take-all system when it comes to the awarding of electors in the presidential contest, the state\u2019s 55 electoral college votes will be allocated to the winner whether that candidate wins by a margin of a single vote or a margin of 5.5 million votes.\n\nWhen it comes to the presidential contest, the poll makes clear voter preferences for presidential candidates in California at present turn on two key issues: (1) Black Lives Matter and (2) attitudes towards the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\u201cThere is a direct relationship between voter appraisals of the President with two issues that are now dominating the news: the Black Lives Matter movement and health threat posed by the coronavirus,\u201d the analysis accompanying the poll released stated.\n\nWith regards to Black Lives Matter:\n\nThe Poll finds that 65% of likely voters in California have a favorable opinion of the Black Lives Matter movement, while 30% view it unfavorably. Among the two-thirds majority who hold positive views of the Black Lives Matter movement nearly all (96%) disapprove of the job Trump is doing as president and 93% are backing Biden for president. By contrast, among the 30% of likely voters who hold an unfavorable opinion of the Black Lives Matter movement 85% approve of the President\u2019s performance and 83% are backing his reelection.\n\nSimilarly, attitudes about the coronavirus pandemic were a referendum on President Trump\u2019s leadership:\n\nAmong the two-thirds majority who view the health threat from the virus as becoming more serious 87% disapprove of the job Trump is doing as president and 84% are backing Biden in the presidential election. Voters who view the health threat as remaining the same are evenly divided in their appraisals of Trump\u2019s performance as president and only narrowly support his re-election. By contrast, among the 12% of voters who feel the health threat posed by the virus is becoming less serious in their area, 89% approve of Trump\u2019s overall performance in office and back his re-election 87% to 10%.\n\nIf voters in California appear on a track to reject Republican candidates on the ballot from top to bottom, it may make the GOP\u2019s attempts to take back the majority in the House of Representatives even more difficult.\n\nPrior to the 2018 mid-term elections, Republicans controlled the House in the 115th Congress by a 236 to 196 margin, with 14 of those Republican seats in California:\n\nRep. Doug LaMalfa (R-CA-1) Tom McClintock (R-CA-4) Rep. Paul Cook (R-CA-8) Rep. Jeff Denham (R-CA-10) Rep. David Valadao (R-CA-21) Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA-22) Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA-23) Rep.

Hunter (R-CA-50)\n\nThirty-nine of the state\u2019s 53 seats at the beginning of the 115th Congress were held by Democrats.\n\nIn the 2018 midterms, Democrats won seven California Congressional Districts previously represented by Republicans, while Republicans failed to win a single California Congressional District previously represented by Democrats. These Democrat victories in California helped flip the House at the beginning of the 116th Congress to Democrat control by a 235 to 199 margin.\n\nOnly six of the state\u2019s 53 seats in the House of Representatives are currently held by Republicans:\n\nRep.

Ken Calvert (R-CA-42)\n\nOne seat formerly held by a Republican (the 50th Congressional District) is vacant, and 46 are held by Democrats.\n\nA Republican takeover of the House of Representatives hinges on the ability of Republicans to take back many, if not all, of the eight seats lost in California to the Democrats in 2018, and perhaps taking back even more.\n\nThe across the board rejection of Republican candidates reported in the Berkeley IGS Poll, if predictive, however, does not bode well for such a Republican comeback in the House races in the Golden State.\n\nHowever, those poll results are belied by the results of the May special election in Califorina\u2019s 25th Congressional District, where Republican candidate Mike Garcia flipped the seat from Democrat control, after former Rep. Katie Hill (D-CA-25) resigned in disgrace over allegations of personal misconduct. Hill was one of the Democrat candidates who flipped a seat from Republican control in the 2018 mid-term elections.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported:\n\nGarcia, a former military pilot, defeated his Democrat opponent Christy Smith (D-Santa Clarita) in a special election to fill a House seat once held by Democrat Katie Hill in Southern California. \u201cI do believe there has been a renaissance and an awakening from the general public, not just Republicans, but Americans in general \u2014 that we really do need to pay attention to who we\u2019re voting for \u2026 and this district is an extremely purple district,\u201d Garcia said in response to a question from Breitbart News Editor-at-Large Rebecca Mansour regarding what his being elected means for national elections.

I think people are recognizing that. I think that this is truly an opportunity of a lifetime for 2020, for our party, for conservatives in general. \u2026 I think we have an opportunity to get the house back, but we\u2019ve got to continue to work our tails off to make sure that that happens and not take it for granted.\u201d\n\nThe Berkeley IGS Poll of 6,756 likely California voters was conducted online between July 21 and July 27 and has a 2 percent margin of error.", "link": "https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/08/04/california-poll-biden-leads-trump-by-39-points-nine-more-than-hillary-in-2016/", "published": "2020-08-04T00:00:00"}, {"title": "CA Poll: Biden Leads Trump by 39 Points, 9 More than Hillary in 2016", "text": "Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden leads President Donald Trump by 39 points in California, 67 percent to 28 percent, according to a Berkeley IGS (Institute of Governmental Studies) poll released on Tuesday.\n\nBiden\u2019s current poll margin is nine points higher than Hillary Clinton\u2019s 30 point margin, 61 percent to 31 percent, over Trump in California in the 2016 presidential election, when she secured 8.7 million votes in the state to Trump\u2019s 4.4 million \u2013 another sign that the most populous state in the country is becoming increasingly radicalized as a far left one-party state.\n\nKey findings of the poll:\n\nBiden\u2019s huge thirty-nine percentage point advantage over Trump among Californians likely to vote in the November presidential election is very broad-based, with majorities of voters in all regions of the state and across virtually all major demographic subgroups of the likely voter population.

I think people are recognizing that. I think that this is truly an opportunity of a lifetime for 2020, for our party, for conservatives in general. \u2026 I think we have an opportunity to get the house back, but we\u2019ve got to continue to work our tails off to make sure that that happens and not take it for granted.\u201d\n\nThe Berkeley IGS Poll of 6,756 likely California voters was conducted online between July 21 and July 27 and has a 2 percent margin of error.", "link": "https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/08/04/california-poll-biden-leads-trump-by-39-points-nine-more-than-hillary-in-2016/#disqus_thread", "published": "2020-08-04T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Donald Trump: Beirut Explosion \u2018Looks Like a Terrible Attack\u2019", "text": "President Donald Trump reacted to the massive explosion in Beirut, Lebanon, on the capital city\u2019s waterfront.\n\n\u201cIt looks like a terrible attack,\u201d Trump said during a press conference at the White House on Tuesday.\n\nHe said that he met with his generals to discuss the explosion and they estimated the explosion was an attack.\n\n\u201cThis was not some kind of manufacturing explosion type of event,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThis was a \u2014 seems to be, according to them.

Instead, he claimed that American experiments were \u201cnot transparent\u201d and \u201cnot safe,\u201d without offering specifics.\n\nWang made his remarks in response to a bizarre question from Beijing Youth Daily, the official newspaper of the Communist Youth League of China. The question claimed that \u201ca large number of social groups\u201d were concerned about joint U.S. and South Korean military activity regarding biological weapons research, which exists because of evidence that North Korea is developing biological weapons. The only recent major report claiming such concerns existed surfaced in Xinhua, the official Chinese state news agency, which claimed America was threatening the world with \u201ca scandalous program it claims to be a defense system against biochemical threat.\u201d\n\nIn reality, the program \u2014 the Joint United States Forces Korea Portal and Integrated Threat Recognition Advanced Technology Demonstration \u2014 may have helped South Korea\u2019s internationally lauded response to the pandemic, as it requires drills in responding to biological attacks, according to a former Obama administration official. South Korean officials, even under left-wing President Moon Jae-in, have embraced military cooperation with Washington and are scheduled to participate in joint exercises before the end of summer.\n\nWang nonetheless treated the Beijing Youth Daily\u2018s concerns as legitimate.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. has conducted activities of biological militarization in many countries which have indeed caused widespread skepticism and opposition,\u201d Wang claimed. \u201cThe reasons are as follows: first, those US biological militarization activities are not transparent. Many of the countries involved have no idea what the US military labs are doing.\u201d\n\n\u201cSecond, they are not safe. Many of their activities are closely related to high-risk pathogens. If any accident occurs, it will have disastrous consequences for the country concerned, its neighbors and the whole world,\u201d Wang added. \u201cThird, they are unjustified.\u201d\n\n\u201cLooking around, only the U.S., spearheaded by its military, is building biological labs around the world and collecting without restraint biological resources abroad,\u201d Wang contended, complaining also that American officials have opposed creating a protocol for the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC), which the U.S. signed, that would allow rogue states like China access to U.S. military facilities.\n\n\u201cWe urge the U.S. side to be a responsible party, take the concerns of the international community seriously, clarify its overseas biological militarization activities, earnestly fulfill its BWC obligations, and stop being the only one that stands in the way of the negotiations on a BWC verification protocol,\u201d Wang concluded.\n\nWang\u2019s claim that only the United States is working to build biological laboratories comes three months after Chinese Communist Party officials announced a plan to build dozens of high-level biosecurity laboratories within China\u2019s borders \u2014 as many as 30 at the second-highest bio-security level and at least one at the top, which would equipment to handle the most dangerous pathogens. China only currently has one such lab: the Wuhan Institute of Virology.\n\nAmerican officials have openly speculated that the Chinese coronavirus pandemic began not with natural transmission from an animal in the streets of Wuhan but at the virology facility.\n\n\u201c[T]he origin of this virus, the nature of it, how it got out into the wild in the way that it did, is something we still have lots of unanswered questions about,\u201d Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in May. \u201cI\u2019ve seen evidence that this likely came from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. I\u2019m happy to see other evidence that disproves that. We should get to the bottom of it.\u201d\n\nBreitbart News revealed in April that U.S. officials are formally investigating the Wuhan Institute of Virology to see if it played a role in the pandemic.\n\nChinese communist officials have adamantly denied any relationship between the laboratory and pandemic, one that could have been more easily clarified if Party officials had not \u201cdisinfected\u201d the wild meat and seafood market where Beijing originally claimed the virus began spreading. By \u201cdisinfecting\u201d the area, officials ensured no evidence existed that could lead epidemiologists to the source.\n\nThe Foreign Ministry has instead blamed a currently closed U.S. Army laboratory in Maryland for the pandemic.\n\n\u201cWhen did patient zero begin in US? How many people are infected? What are the names of the hospitals?\u201d Zhao Lijian, another Foreign Ministry spokesman, asked on Twitter in March. \u201cIt might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan.\u201d\n\nThe state-run Global Times propaganda outlet fleshed out the Fort Detrick, Maryland, theory. The Foreign Ministry later suggested that cases of \u201ce-cigarette disease,\u201d a series of lung injuries affiliated with vaping using cheaply made products from China, could be cases of Chinese coronavirus. Studies on patients with vaping lung injuries have shown that no pathogen causes them and they are not carrying any contagious disease; doctors have treated them without protective gear and not gotten sick.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "link": "https://www.breitbart.com/asia/2020/08/04/china-accuses-us-military-dangerous-experiments-high-risk-pathogens/", "published": "2020-08-04T00:00:00"}, {"title": "China: U.S. Conducting 'Unreasonable' Bio-Military Activities", "text": "China\u2019s Foreign Ministry accused the United States military on Tuesday of terrifying the world with mysterious biological weapons experiments, demanding the U.S. \u201ctake the concerns of the international community seriously\u201d and cease the alleged research.\n\nThe Communist Party has repeatedly hinted at the Chinese coronavirus pandemic being the product of an accident at a U.S. Army facility, providing no evidence for the outlandish claim.

The question claimed that \u201ca large number of social groups\u201d were concerned about joint U.S. and South Korean military activity regarding biological weapons research, which exists because of evidence that North Korea is developing biological weapons. The only recent major report claiming such concerns existed surfaced in Xinhua, the official Chinese state news agency, which claimed America was threatening the world with \u201ca scandalous program it claims to be a defense system against biochemical threat.\u201d\n\nIn reality, the program \u2014 the Joint United States Forces Korea Portal and Integrated Threat Recognition Advanced Technology Demonstration \u2014 may have helped South Korea\u2019s internationally lauded response to the pandemic, as it requires drills in responding to biological attacks, according to a former Obama administration official. South Korean officials, even under left-wing President Moon Jae-in, have embraced military cooperation with Washington and are scheduled to participate in joint exercises before the end of summer.\n\nWang nonetheless treated the Beijing Youth Daily\u2018s concerns as legitimate.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. has conducted activities of biological militarization in many countries which have indeed caused widespread skepticism and opposition,\u201d Wang claimed. \u201cThe reasons are as follows: first, those US biological militarization activities are not transparent. Many of the countries involved have no idea what the US military labs are doing.\u201d\n\n\u201cSecond, they are not safe. Many of their activities are closely related to high-risk pathogens. If any accident occurs, it will have disastrous consequences for the country concerned, its neighbors and the whole world,\u201d Wang added. \u201cThird, they are unjustified.\u201d\n\n\u201cLooking around, only the U.S., spearheaded by its military, is building biological labs around the world and collecting without restraint biological resources abroad,\u201d Wang contended, complaining also that American officials have opposed creating a protocol for the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC), which the U.S. signed, that would allow rogue states like China access to U.S. military facilities.\n\n\u201cWe urge the U.S. side to be a responsible party, take the concerns of the international community seriously, clarify its overseas biological militarization activities, earnestly fulfill its BWC obligations, and stop being the only one that stands in the way of the negotiations on a BWC verification protocol,\u201d Wang concluded.\n\nWang\u2019s claim that only the United States is working to build biological laboratories comes three months after Chinese Communist Party officials announced a plan to build dozens of high-level biosecurity laboratories within China\u2019s borders \u2014 as many as 30 at the second-highest bio-security level and at least one at the top, which would equipment to handle the most dangerous pathogens. China only currently has one such lab: the Wuhan Institute of Virology.\n\nAmerican officials have openly speculated that the Chinese coronavirus pandemic began not with natural transmission from an animal in the streets of Wuhan but at the virology facility.\n\n\u201c[T]he origin of this virus, the nature of it, how it got out into the wild in the way that it did, is something we still have lots of unanswered questions about,\u201d Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in May. \u201cI\u2019ve seen evidence that this likely came from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. I\u2019m happy to see other evidence that disproves that. We should get to the bottom of it.\u201d\n\nBreitbart News revealed in April that U.S. officials are formally investigating the Wuhan Institute of Virology to see if it played a role in the pandemic.\n\nChinese communist officials have adamantly denied any relationship between the laboratory and pandemic, one that could have been more easily clarified if Party officials had not \u201cdisinfected\u201d the wild meat and seafood market where Beijing originally claimed the virus began spreading. By \u201cdisinfecting\u201d the area, officials ensured no evidence existed that could lead epidemiologists to the source.\n\nThe Foreign Ministry has instead blamed a currently closed U.S. Army laboratory in Maryland for the pandemic.\n\n\u201cWhen did patient zero begin in US? How many people are infected? What are the names of the hospitals?\u201d Zhao Lijian, another Foreign Ministry spokesman, asked on Twitter in March. \u201cIt might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan.\u201d\n\nThe state-run Global Times propaganda outlet fleshed out the Fort Detrick, Maryland, theory. The Foreign Ministry later suggested that cases of \u201ce-cigarette disease,\u201d a series of lung injuries affiliated with vaping using cheaply made products from China, could be cases of Chinese coronavirus. Studies on patients with vaping lung injuries have shown that no pathogen causes them and they are not carrying any contagious disease; doctors have treated them without protective gear and not gotten sick.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "link": "https://www.breitbart.com/asia/2020/08/04/china-accuses-us-military-dangerous-experiments-high-risk-pathogens/#disqus_thread", "published": "2020-08-04T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Trump Campaign Encourages Supporters to Wear Masks: \u2018We Have Nothing to Lose\u2019", "text": "In an e-mail sent by his campaign on Monday, President Donald Trump said wearing masks is \u201csomething we should all try to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cFriend,\u201d the letter opens, \u201cI know how difficult the past few months have been.

However, those numbers differ slightly from daily reports given in a separate \u201carchives\u201d page \u2014 which posts an updated total death count, drawn from the Department\u2019s Vital Records Program as of 11:59 PM on the previous date and broken down by county.\n\nAccording to the department\u2019s archives, Pennsylvania reported 518 deaths total in July, comparing totaled figures from July 1 and August 3 (the end of the month fell on a Friday) \u2014 an average of 16.7 per day. According to a Department of Health spokesperson, no date of death is given on these reports, so it is unclear how many occurred in earlier months and how many occurred in July. The CDC cautions that its own count of death certificates can come between one to eight weeks after a death occurs, but the PA spokesperson was not able to similarly estimate an average lag for its own figures.\n\nThis month\u2019s total is a 53.5009% decrease from the 1,114 deaths reported in June, according to these same archives. On average last month, the state saw roughly 37.13 deaths per day.\n\nTwenty-four counties did not record any new deaths in July. Seventeen of those counties had previously recorded deaths: Armstrong, Bedford, Bradford, Cambria, Clarion, Fayette, Forest, Huntingdon, Indiana, Jefferson, Juniata, McKean, Mifflin, Perry, Snyder, Tioga, Union, and Warren. Seven of those counties have not yet reported any deaths: Cameron, Clearfield, Forest, Northumberland, Potter, Sullivan, and Venango. Of those 24 counties, only Cambria and Fayette have populations over 100,000.\n\nOne county\u2019s count actually decreased by one \u2014 Wayne County, whose total changed from nine to eight deaths on the report dated July 8. A Department of Health spokesperson explained that, occasionally, a reported death may need to shift to a different county to match the legal residence of the decedent, and some data may be revised or clarified based on new information. That anomaly is not counted against the total death reports in this reporting.\n\nNineteen counties reported three or fewer deaths in July: Blair (2), Butler (2), Carbon (2), Centre (3), Clinton (1), Columbia (1), Crawford (1), Elk (2), Franklin (2), Fulton (1), Greene (1), Lawrence (3), Lycoming (1), Mercer (3), Montour (2), Pike (1), Somerset (1), Susquehanna (2), and Wyoming (1). Three of those counties reported their first coronavirus deaths since the start of the pandemic: Crawford, Elk, and Greene.\n\nEight counties reported four to ten deaths: Adams (7), Cumberland (6), Erie (4), Lackawanna (8), Luzerne (6), Schuylkill (5), Washington (5), and Westmoreland (8).\n\nSeven counties reported 11 to 20 deaths: Beaver (11), Berks (14), Bucks (14), Chester (19), Dauphin (20), Lebanon (11), and Monroe (15).\n\nAnd eight counties reported more than 20 deaths: Allegheny (47), Delaware (32), Lancaster (43), Lehigh (35), Montgomery (46), Northampton (22), Philadelphia (70), and York (38). Of these eight, Philadelphia maintains the highest total deaths (1,681), followed by Montgomery (850), Delaware (687), and Bucks (579). No other counties have yet reached 500 total deaths since the state began taking these records in March.\n\nFor comparison, the most recent public PA death statistics \u2014 from the year 2018 \u2014 marks the state\u2019s top causes of death as heart disease (32,713 deaths for the year, an average of 2,726 per month), cancer/malignant neoplasms (27,995 deaths for the year, an average of 2,332 per month), and nontransport accidents (7,207 for the year, an average of 600 per month). [These data were provided by the Pennsylvania Department of Health. The Department specifically disclaims responsibility for any analyses, interpretations, or conclusions.]\n\nThese figures reveal a key metric in the ongoing debate over the state\u2019s lockdown measures. As testing became more widely available, confirmed cases began to rise in mid-June, but, more than a month later, coronavirus deaths have not followed that trend.

However, those numbers differ slightly from daily reports given in a separate \u201carchives\u201d page \u2014 which posts an updated total death count, drawn from the Department\u2019s Vital Records Program as of 11:59 PM on the previous date and broken down by county.\n\nAccording to the department\u2019s archives, Pennsylvania reported 518 deaths total in July, comparing totaled figures from July 1 and August 3 (the end of the month fell on a Friday) \u2014 an average of 16.7 per day. According to a Department of Health spokesperson, no date of death is given on these reports, so it is unclear how many occurred in earlier months and how many occurred in July. The CDC cautions that its own count of death certificates can come between one to eight weeks after a death occurs, but the PA spokesperson was not able to similarly estimate an average lag for its own figures.\n\nThis month\u2019s total is a 53.5009% decrease from the 1,114 deaths reported in June, according to these same archives. On average last month, the state saw roughly 37.13 deaths per day.\n\nTwenty-four counties did not record any new deaths in July. Seventeen of those counties had previously recorded deaths: Armstrong, Bedford, Bradford, Cambria, Clarion, Fayette, Forest, Huntingdon, Indiana, Jefferson, Juniata, McKean, Mifflin, Perry, Snyder, Tioga, Union, and Warren. Seven of those counties have not yet reported any deaths: Cameron, Clearfield, Forest, Northumberland, Potter, Sullivan, and Venango. Of those 24 counties, only Cambria and Fayette have populations over 100,000.\n\nOne county\u2019s count actually decreased by one \u2014 Wayne County, whose total changed from nine to eight deaths on the report dated July 8. A Department of Health spokesperson explained that, occasionally, a reported death may need to shift to a different county to match the legal residence of the decedent, and some data may be revised or clarified based on new information. That anomaly is not counted against the total death reports in this reporting.\n\nNineteen counties reported three or fewer deaths in July: Blair (2), Butler (2), Carbon (2), Centre (3), Clinton (1), Columbia (1), Crawford (1), Elk (2), Franklin (2), Fulton (1), Greene (1), Lawrence (3), Lycoming (1), Mercer (3), Montour (2), Pike (1), Somerset (1), Susquehanna (2), and Wyoming (1). Three of those counties reported their first coronavirus deaths since the start of the pandemic: Crawford, Elk, and Greene.\n\nEight counties reported four to ten deaths: Adams (7), Cumberland (6), Erie (4), Lackawanna (8), Luzerne (6), Schuylkill (5), Washington (5), and Westmoreland (8).\n\nSeven counties reported 11 to 20 deaths: Beaver (11), Berks (14), Bucks (14), Chester (19), Dauphin (20), Lebanon (11), and Monroe (15).\n\nAnd eight counties reported more than 20 deaths: Allegheny (47), Delaware (32), Lancaster (43), Lehigh (35), Montgomery (46), Northampton (22), Philadelphia (70), and York (38). Of these eight, Philadelphia maintains the highest total deaths (1,681), followed by Montgomery (850), Delaware (687), and Bucks (579). No other counties have yet reached 500 total deaths since the state began taking these records in March.\n\nFor comparison, the most recent public PA death statistics \u2014 from the year 2018 \u2014 marks the state\u2019s top causes of death as heart disease (32,713 deaths for the year, an average of 2,726 per month), cancer/malignant neoplasms (27,995 deaths for the year, an average of 2,332 per month), and nontransport accidents (7,207 for the year, an average of 600 per month). [These data were provided by the Pennsylvania Department of Health. The Department specifically disclaims responsibility for any analyses, interpretations, or conclusions.]\n\nThese figures reveal a key metric in the ongoing debate over the state\u2019s lockdown measures. As testing became more widely available, confirmed cases began to rise in mid-June, but, more than a month later, coronavirus deaths have not followed that trend. The number of PA hospitalizations bottomed out in mid-July, slowly rose until the end of the month, then dropped quickly \u2014 reportedly due to a change in the federal government\u2019s reporting process.\n\nAs of July 3, all 67 counties reached the \u201cgreen phase\u201d of Governor Tom Wolf\u2019s reopening plan \u2014 which allowed for gatherings of up to 250 people, with religious services exempted but \u201cstrongly encouraged\u201d to resume with social distancing and masks in use.

The Walt Disney Co. said Tuesday that it will debut its live-action blockbuster on its subscription streaming service, Disney+, on Sept. 4.\n\nBut this is no \u201cHamilton\u201d: Customers will have to pay an additional $29.99 on top of the cost of the monthly subscription to rent \u201cMulan.\u201d The company plans to release it in theaters in areas where Disney+ is not available.\n\n\u201cIn order to meet the needs of consumers during this unpredictable period, we thought it was important to find alternative ways to bring this exceptional family-friendly film to them in a timely manner,\u201d Disney CEO Bob Chapek said on the company\u2019s earnings call. \u201cWe see this as an opportunity to bring this incredible film to a broad audience currently unable to go to movie theaters.\u201d\n\nThe live-action remake of the animated film was one of the first major films to be affected by the coronavirus pandemic. Originally set for a March 27 release, \u201cMulan\u201d moved to late July, then late August and was then pulled from the calendar all together as COVID-19 cases spiked through the U.S.\n\nAlong with Warner Bros.\u2019 \u201cTenet,\u201d \u201cMulan\u201d was going to be one of the first major movies to open in theaters since the shutdown. Exhibitors, most of which have been closed for over four months, have been desperate for new films that would help draw wary audiences back to theaters.\n\nBut while Warner Bros. is moving forward with a theatrical release plan, which involves opening \u201cTenet\u201d internationally first and then in select U.S. theaters a week later, on Sept. 3, Disney decided to pivot and direct consumers to its streaming service.\n\nIt is not unprecedented for a major studio to offer a premium video on demand release during the pandemic. Universal Pictures debuted \u201cTrolls World Tour\u201d on streaming in April while most theaters were shuttered. Although it caused a major rift at the time, it has since led to an historic compromise between the nation\u2019s largest theater chain and Universal to shrink its theatrical window to 17 days.\n\nBut few expected \u201cMulan,\u201d a $200 million production, to go this route, even Disney. In late June, when announcing its delay to August, Disney executives Alan Horn and Alan Bergman wrote in a joint statement that \u201cMulan\u201d was, \u201cEverything the cinematic experience should be, and that\u2019s where we believe it belongs\u2014on the world stage and the big screen for audiences around the globe to enjoy together.\u201d", "link": "https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2020/08/05/disney-to-release-mulan-on-streaming-for-30-in-september/", "published": "2020-08-05T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Nolte: Brian Stelter Is Gaslighting You About CNN\u2019s Push for Biden to Skip Debates", "text": "After far-left CNN aired a segment urging Joe Biden to skip the presidential debates, CNNLOL\u2019s Brian Stelter falsely claimed this narrative is fueled by \u201cright-wing media.\u201d\n\nYes, the basement-rated Stelter, a left-wing anti-Trump activist and a proven liar who regularly spreads conspiracy theories, was again shining his gaslight Monday night with another deliberate attempt to deceive the public.\n\nResponding to a tweet where Townhall\u2019s Guy Benson asked, \u201cThis \u2018Biden shouldn\u2019t debate\u2019 boomlet is just a media tempest, right? Right?,\u201d Stelter responded with, \u201cIt is mostly a right-wing media tempest, fueled by hour after hour of Fox commentary (not reporting), far removed from campaign reality\u2026\u201d\n\nAnd yet it was just a couple days ago when former Bill Clinton Press Secretary Joe Lockhart appeared on CNNLOL to urge Biden to skip the debates.\n\nOh, and Lockhart\u2019s CNNLOL appearance happened just days after Lockhart published a piece urging Biden to skip the debates at \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 CNNLOL [emphasis original].\n\nWhatever you do, don\u2019t debate Trump. Trump has now made more than 20,000 misleading or false statements according to the Washington Post. It\u2019s a fool\u2019s errand to enter the ring with someone who can\u2019t follow the rules or the truth. Biden will undoubtedly take heat from Republicans and the media for skipping the debates. But it\u2019s worth the risk as trying to debate someone incapable of telling the truth is an impossible contest to win.\n\nBut wait. There\u2019s more\u2026\n\nOver this same weekend, the far-left New York Times published an op-ed urging the cancellation of this year\u2019s presidential debates. On top of that, whatever is left of the far-left Newsweek also published a piece about the boomlet of support for the idea of Biden skipping the debates.\n\nA number of Democrats, including Bill Kristol, are urging that the debates be canceled.\n\nA former senior adviser to Hillary Clinton agrees: \u201cBiden shouldn\u2019t feel obligated to throw Trump a lifeline by granting him any debates at all. This is not a normal presidential election and Trump is not a legitimate candidate,\u201d Zac Petkanas tweeted last week.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Thomas Friedman, an anti-Trump New York Times columnist, who urged Biden just last week not to debate the president unless Trump agrees to \u201ctwo conditions.\u201d Of course those conditions are ridiculous \u2014 Trump must release his tax returns and agree to \u201creal-time fact checking\u201d during the debate \u2014 and will never be agreed to, and therefore ensure there will be no debates.\n\nSo there\u2019s no question Biden supporters and the media are colluding to lay the groundwork for Biden to announce a withdrawal from the debates in a way that will do the least amount of damage to his presidential campaign. So the question is, why is Brian Stelter lying about this being the product of the right-wing media?\n\nWell, I think there are two reasons\u2026\n\nThe first is that Stelter is a liar and sometimes liars just lie to lie, for the pure enjoyment of it, out of habit.\n\nSecondly, I don\u2019t think it took very long for media elites to figure out that trying to help Biden weasel out of the debates is damaging to Biden. Regardless of their absurd excuses to justify annihilating a 60-year tradition, the narrative is backfiring; it further exposes Biden as weak and timid, and now everyone regrets floating the idea. So\u2026\n\nThey sent Tater out to lie about the source of the idea, to blame-shift, because that\u2019s what Tater does: he lies, he serially sacrifices his integrity for The Cause. He\u2019s more than happy to make a brazen fool of himself if it means a pat on the head from CNNLOL chief Jeff Zucker.\n\nStelter is the left\u2019s stooge, their crash-test dummy.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

The suggestion by the office of the district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., came in a new federal court filing arguing that Mr. Trump\u2019s accountants should have to comply with a subpoena seeking eight years of his personal and corporate tax returns. Mr. Trump had asked a judge to declare the subpoena invalid. \u2026 In the new filing, the prosecutors did not directly identify the subject of their inquiry. But they said that \u201cundisputed\u201d assertions in earlier court papers and several news reports about Mr. Trump\u2019s business practices showed that the office had a wide legal basis for the subpoena. \u2026 They cited newspaper investigations that concluded the president may have illegally inflated his net worth and the value of his properties to lenders and insurers. They also included an article on the congressional testimony of his former lawyer and fixer, Michael D. Cohen, who told lawmakers last year that the president had committed insurance fraud. Lawyers for the president have denied wrongdoing.\n\nThe links above all refer to reporting by the New York Times, which apparently is the source for Vance\u2019s claims of possible fraud.\n\nVance\u2019s filing comes after the Supreme Court ruled in a pair of cases last month that the president could not demand that local prosecutors meet a heightened burden for an ordinary subpoena, but that Congress did not have the right to demand whatever documents it wanted of the president.\n\nJoel B.

But the accident caused Mr. Nadler to be an hour late to the hearing.\n\nWatching Mr. Nadler during that hearing, which starred Attorney General William Barr, you might think he had hit his head in the accident. But, alas, Mr. Nadler was already that dumb. Even before the accident, he was severely damaged goods.\n\nThat said, it is always unwise to underestimate Mr. Nadler. Just ask House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, the slender California Democrat with a long neck.\n\nIn a race to a microphone on the Senate floor earlier this year during the impeachment proceedings, Mr. Schiff thought he could just take his time and slowly saunter over. Something about Mr. Nadler made Mr. Schiff think he could play rabbit to Mr. Nadler\u2019s tortoise to the microphone.\n\nWith a microphone serving as the carrot, Mr. Nadler proved swifter than any rabbit. Mr. Schiff was left spinning in Mr. Nadler\u2019s dust. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, reigning world champion in the five-yard microphone dash, marveled from the peanut gallery at Mr. Nadler\u2019s Olympic abilities.\n\nPerhaps, it was the waiting microphone before the empty chair in the House Judiciary Committee hearing room last week that saved Mr. Nadler\u2019s life. No mere automobile accident would keep him from holding court \u2014 especially when he himself is the court jester.\n\nAs it turned out, the automobile accident was so minor that the airbag did not deploy \u2014 until he got seated in the hearing room. And then the giant airbag EXPLODED.\n\n\u201cYou really can\u2019t hide behind legal fictions,\u201d Mr. Nadler raged at Mr. Barr, who had just explained that as a member of President Trump\u2019s Cabinet he was not at liberty to divulge privileged discussions with the president.\n\nThough Mr. Nadler attended law school, it is not clear if he was ever a terribly successful lawyer. Somewhere along the line, however, he got struck with just enough common sense to realize that the rioting in the streets that he and fellow Democrats refuse to condemn and Mr. Nadler is on record calling \u201ca myth\u201d does not look very good heading into an election.\n\nSo, Mr. Nadler sought to blame the riots on Mr. Barr and, by extension, on Mr. Trump. Yes, Mr. Nadler \u2014 AKA the exploded airbag \u2014 blames the riots on the only people who are lifting a finger to curb the riots and enforce, you know, the laws. You know, the ones arresting rioters for assaulting innocent people, firebombing public buildings, torching police cars, and using lasers to blind officers.\n\n\u201cThe president wants footage for his campaign and you appear to be serving it up to him as ordered,\u201d Mr. Nadler wheezed.\n\nYes, the looting and arson and bloodshed, the roping of statues in Washington, D.C., and Portland, Oregon, is all the fault of President Trump. And Bill Barr.\n\n\u201cShame on you, Mr. Barr! Shame on you!\u201d\n\nBy then, all the air had leaked out of the giant airbag and when Mr. Barr offered to answer the questions he had been called into the hearing for, the wheedling Nadler could only gasp, \u201cMy time has expired. My time has expired.\u201d\n\nThe whole hearing proved as enlightening as a clown car smash-up derby. Nobody was actually seeking answers. They just wanted to scream at Mr. Barr. And, whenever the attorney general offered to reply, they shouted, \u201cReclaiming my time!\u201d\n\nAs Mr. Barr noted, this is not normally how hearings go. Usually, the government official (in this case, Mr. Barr) is required to provide actual answers to actual questions posed by the committee.\n\nBut these are no more \u201chearings\u201d than the bloodthirsty arson and mayhem in the streets are \u201cprotests.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s all smash-and-grab politics and Jerold Nadler is the mythical airbag lording over all of it.\n\n\u2022 Charles Hurt is opinion editor of The Washington Times.

They know that their candidate\u2019s poll numbers depend entirely on voters being unable to see or hear him speak.\n\nIf Biden is allowed to talk in public, he will ruin everything. That\u2019s why this summer, The New York Times ran a piece by Tom Friedman saying that Biden shouldn\u2019t debate unless Trump releases his tax returns. It was an obvious ploy.

It had nothing to do with Joe Biden\u2019s inability to think clearly, just fairness.\n\nBut leave it to former Bill Clinton press secretary, Joe Lockhart, the dumbest person ever to hold that job to shatter the facade.\n\nIn a column last week, conspicuously titled, \u201cJoe Biden could still lose this election,\u201d Joe Lockhart spelled out his prescription directly to Biden.

Irony, of course, is dead. The pallbearer is Joe Lockhart.\n\nBut Lockhart is hardly alone. Strategists and operatives have received their marching orders.

allow for abortion on demand to be available up to birth in Kenya through a broad interpretation of the term \u2018health.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe international NGOs who are backing this bill \u201chave used a legislation change model in a number of other countries where they have lobbied for a law change, which in practice introduces abortion on demand, for any reason.\u201d\n\nIn the case of Ghana, for instance, where legislation with similar wording was passed, materials were published alongside the law instructing healthcare professionals \u201cto take a very broad interpretation of what appears to be similar restrictive wording,\u201d LifeNews.com said, which \u201chas in practice allowed abortion for any reason, on-demand.\u201d\n\nAlong with allowing healthcare workers broad leeway in determining when to perform an abortion, the bill also stipulates a three-year jail sentence for any health professional who conscientiously objects to being complicit in the abortion process and refuses to refer the patient to another health professional willing to provide an abortion.\n\nA significant majority of Kenyans oppose abortion, suggesting that this provision in the legislation \u201ccould have a very wide negative impact, forcing many health professionals to act against their conscience, or for a likely large group of health professionals who do not wish to be complicit in the abortion process, this would mean they face jail time,\u201d LifeNews.com notes.\n\nOther groups are also addressing the issue:\n\n87% of Kenyans do not support abortion on demand and 82% of Kenyans believed abortion to be morally unacceptable. \ud83d\udc4f Despite this, the country could introduce abortion up to birth, under radical Bill pushed by international abortion organisations.

Justice Minister Nasredeen Abdulbari officially announced them for the first time on Sunday.\n\n\u201cWe [will] drop all the laws violating the human rights in Sudan,\u201d Abdulbari said, the BBC reported.\n\nAs part of the new reforms, Sudan has banned FGM, a barbaric ritual in which part or all of a girl\u2019s genitalia is removed. Extremely dangerous, the mutilation can cause the girl to endure severe physical and psychological trauma for life and often results in death. Countries in Africa record the world\u2019s highest rates of FGM, considered a violation of human rights by the World Health Organization.\n\nKenya recently recorded a marked increase in FGM cases during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, despite the country criminalizing the act in 2011. Parents reportedly took advantage of school closures during coronavirus shutdowns to perform the procedure on their daughters. The Kenya example highlights that a nominal ban on the practice may not necessarily result its in eradication from Sudan.\n\nSudan claims it will also no longer require women to seek permission from a male relative if they want to travel, especially if they are traveling with children, RFI reported.\n\nAlso under the new reforms, non-Muslims in Sudan are now allowed to drink alcohol for the first time in almost 40 years; the prohibition on alcohol dates back to 1983 when Sudan\u2019s President Jaafar Nimeiri established Sharia law in the Islamist country, according to the report. Non-Muslims constitute about three percent of Sudan\u2019s total population. The new alcohol law stipulates that non-Muslims must consume alcohol \u201cin private.\u201d They are banned from partaking in the presence of Muslims, for whom drinking alcohol remains illegal.\n\nAccording to the new laws, Sudanese people no longer face prosecution for apostasy, or \u201cabandoning Islam.\u201d Previously, \u201canyone convicted of renouncing Islam, or apostasy, could face the death penalty,\u201d in Sudan, the BBC reported.\n\nThis also supports women\u2019s rights, as \u201cSharia law forbids a Muslim woman from marrying outside of her religion,\u201d RFI reported. In 2014, a pregnant woman in Sudan named Meriam Yehya Ibrahim Ishag was jailed and sentenced to death for marrying a fellow Christian. Ibrahim\u2019s father was allegedly Muslim, but she was raised by her mother and never practiced the faith. This was not enough to prevent an apostasy charge. Ibrahim gave birth in prison in Sudan before, in response to international pressure, Sudan released her and allowed her family to travel to America.\n\nUntil now, Sudan\u2019s \u201cmorality police would often carry out public flogging for various misdemeanors,\u201d the BBC reported.

left-wing organizations.\n\nHis comments, made while he toured the Home Front Command headquarters in Ramle, came after his son, Yair Netanyahu, referred to the anti-government protesters as \u201caliens\u201d a day earlier.\n\nThe younger Netanyahu in a radio interview said his father was \u201centertained\u201d and even emboldened by clips he shows him of the demonstrations outside the prime minister\u2019s residence on Jerusalem\u2019s Balfour Street.\n\n\u201cI try not to show him obscene things from the protests, because in the end it is unpleasant, but you know, it entertains him, the truth is that it even gives him some strength,\u201d Yair Netanyahu said.\n\nEarlier in the month, a female demonstrator sparked outcry for stripping down and exposing her breasts atop a menorah, the ostensible symbol of the Israeli state, while waving a red antifa flag.\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s son said his father would not follow in the footsteps of late Likud leader Menachem Begin, who resigned from office due to massive public pressure in the form of mass protests over his government\u2019s handling of the 1982 Lebanon War.\n\n\u201cMy father\u2019s a strong man. It makes him laugh,\u201d Netanyahu said.\n\nOn Tuesday, the elder Netanyahu said that \u201cgovernments are replaced only in the ballot box,\u201d not demonstrations.\n\n\u05de\u05e2\u05e6\u05e8 \u05d0\u05d7\u05e8\u05d9 \u05de\u05e2\u05e6\u05e8. \u05d4\u05de\u05e9\u05d8\u05e8\u05d4 \u05de\u05e4\u05d6\u05e8\u05ea \u05d0\u05ea \u05d4\u05d4\u05e4\u05d2\u05e0\u05d4 \u05d1\u05db\u05d7. \u05db\u05e9\u05e2\u05d4 \u05de\u05d4\u05e8\u05d2\u05e2 \u05e9\u05d4\u05d5\u05db\u05e8\u05d6\u05d4 \u05db\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d7\u05d5\u05e7\u05d9\u05ea pic.twitter.com/wVUohFpyb3 \u2014 \u05d9\u05d5\u05d1\u05dc \u05e9\u05d2\u05d1 | Yuval Segev (@Segev_Yuval) August 1, 2020\n\n\u201cThey are political left-wing protests fueled by left-wing organizations and unfortunately encouraged by the media,\u201d the prime minister said. \u201cThere are strange phenomena with non-stop incitement against me, my wife and my family. There are even direct calls for murder that are barely reported.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to Galey Israel radio, Yair Netanyahu said: \u201cHe sees what we all see \u2014 these aliens at the protests. It makes him laugh, like entertainment.\u201d\n\nHe later clarified on Twitter: \u201cWhen I spoke about \u2018aliens,\u2019 at the left-wing protests in Jerusalem, I meant those who are dressed up as aliens and UFOs, those who strip, those who dress up as genitals, those who brandish crude signs, those who put a spaghetti pot on their heads and those dressed up as Spider-Man. There are too many of these, and it\u2019s funny.\n\n\u201cThe rest is really not funny \u2014 the incitement and the explicit calls for murder that are intensifying each day and breaking records in terms of the ceaseless encouragement of the media.\u201d\n\nLikud coalition chairman Miki Zohar, who was later asked in a TV interview if he shared Yair Netanyahu\u2019s \u201caliens\u201d view, said: \u201cI\u2019ll say one thing about those demonstrators. They\u2019re not gathering\u2026 to shout about their difficulties and their problems. They are anarchists, most of them funded [to demonstrate]\u2026. They are prepared to infect the entire state of Israel with coronavirus for the sake of their exhibition of hatred. They are very dangerous people. And some of them speak very violently, very dangerously.\u201d\n\nResponding to the prime minister\u2019s comments on Tuesday, the Black Flag movement, one of the protest\u2019s main organizers, said that \u201cthe worst prime minister in the history of the State of Israel is continuing his panic attacks, but we will continue to see him outside on Balfour Street.\u201d\n\nOpposition leader Yair Lapid responded that \u201cwhat is truly a strange manifestation is a government with 36 ministers (there are 34) at a time of an economic crisis with 21% unemployment and a million shekels in tax benefits for a prime minister when people don\u2019t have what to eat.\u201d He added that a prime minister with three criminal indictments was also a \u201cstrange manifestation.\u201d\n\nNetanyahu has described the protests as a \u201ccorona incubator\u201d and has accused them of being funded by his enemies, including former prime minister Ehud Barak.", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2020/08/04/netanyahu-left-wing-protests-against-me-strange-manifestations-of-incitement-calls-for-my-murder/", "published": "2020-08-04T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Trump: U.S. Will \u2018Probably\u2019 Have Between 4,000 and 5,000 Troops in Afghanistan by Election Day", "text": "During an interview broadcast on Monday\u2019s edition of \u201cAxios on HBO,\u201d President Trump stated that the United States will decrease its troop levels in Afghanistan down to 4,000 troops \u201cvery soon.\u201d And stated that on Election Day, the United States will have \u201cProbably anywhere from 4 to 5,000\u201d soldiers in Afghanistan.\n\nTrump said, \u201cWe\u2019ll be down, in a very short period of time, to 8,000.

At press time, Iran has admitted to 17,405 deaths.\n\nIn contrast, what the BBC reported to appear to be legitimate Iranian government documents revealed that officials had actually documented nearly 42,000 deaths by July 20, a figure likely to have increased significantly in two weeks since publication. The equivalent official count by July 20 showed 14,405 deaths. Similarly, the BBC reported that 451,024 cases appeared in the secret government logs for a timeframe in which Iran had claimed to the outside world it had documented 278,827 cases.\n\nThe BBC claimed an anonymous source within the government sent in the documents and that they show not just numerical statistics, but identifying information for each individual case, \u201cincluding names, age, gender, symptoms, date and length of periods spent in hospital, and underlying conditions patients might have.\u201d Information already compiled by a BBC investigation reportedly confirmed many of the names on the list.\n\nThe British news agency noted that the leaked documents revealed several damning details beyond the sheer number of those killed by the Chinese coronavirus, among them the fact that official estimates were publically five times smaller in March than the documents showed and that first case identified in the document occurred on February 19.\n\nAccording to the BBC document, 52 people had died of Chinese coronavirus by the time Iran admitted its first case.\n\nThat first case in the leaked data appears as having been confirmed on January 22, a particularly volatile month in Iranian politics following the U.S. airstrike against Iranian terror chief Major General Qasem Soleimani. Iran was facing severe international criticism at the time for responding to the airstrike taking out a senior member of the terrorist Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) by shooting down an unrelated Ukrainian passenger jet, killing everyone on board, and lying about it, blaming \u201cmechanical error.\u201d\n\nAnother difference between official figures and those in the leak that BBC identified is the high number of individuals on the secret list identified as foreigners, most considered migrant workers or refugees. The Iranian regime has a long history of abusing Afghan refugees in particular, which reports have revealed Tehran has used as cannon fodder to help its ally Bashar al-Assad in the Syrian Civil War. A report published in May also documented a case in which Iranian border guards laughed as they tortured and drowned Afghan refugees. Iran flatly denied that the incident occurred.\n\nThe BBC statistics support months of efforts by both independent journalists and Iranian dissident activists, who have consistently revealed not only evidence of Iranian regime falsification of numbers, but translated statements by local Iranian officials like mayors and hospital administrators who complained that the case totals out of Tehran were smaller than the sum of the totals out of cities and provinces.\n\nThe largest estimate of the true number of people in Iran affected by the virus is at over 81,000 deaths as of Sunday. The National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) published that number, an update of its regular tally of cases culled from on-the-ground sources in hospitals and local government. The NCRI and its affiliate, the People\u2019s Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI/MEK), constitute Iran\u2019s largest dissident organization.\n\nNCRI noted in the publication of its latest number on Sunday that Iran is experiencing a spike in the number of coronavirus deaths and cases nationwide, despite months of community spread.\n\n\u201cTwenty cities in Mazandaran province are in code red and two are in alarming conditions. The number of Covid-19 [Chinese coronavirus] cases hospitalized have doubled in the past six weeks and the increase in the number of coronavirus cases in Mazandaran are truly concerning,\u201d a spokesman for the Iranian Health Ministry said on Sunday, according to an NCRI translation. \u201cSeven cities and towns in Lorestan province are in code red while three are in alarming conditions.\u201d\n\nIranian media covered the spokesperson\u2019s remarks, but emphasized in other reports alleged support for its handling of the pandemic from the World Health Organization (W.H.O.), a global agency with close ties to Iran\u2019s ally China, the origin nation of the pandemic.\n\nAccording to the state-run Mehr News Agency, W.H.O. representative in the country Christoph Hamelmann praised Tehran for its allegedly efficient response in procuring protective gear for hospitals and beds for critically ill patients.\n\n\u201cThere is a good balance in the reception of patients suffering from coronavirus,\u201d Mehr quoted Hamelmann as saying.\u201d\n\nHigher-level W.H.O. officials have condemned Iran for misreporting its Chinese coronavirus numbers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve said the weakest link in their chain is the data. They are rapidly increasing their ability to test and so the numbers will go up,\u201d Rick Brennan, Director of Emergency Operations for the W.H.O.\u2019s Emergencies Program, said in March.\n\nWhile W.H.O. officials have been reluctant to condemn Iran\u2019s handling of the pandemic, Health Minister Saaed Namaki lamented his government\u2019s \u201cembarrassing\u201d display in July, condemning President Hassan Rouhani personally for \u201chaving no economic plan\u201d and failing to take the virus seriously. To the extent Namaki has said anything positive about Iran\u2019s response to the virus \u2013 which he leads \u2013 he has attributed it to \u201cGod\u2019s grace.\u201d\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/08/03/leaked-government-records-show-iran-death-toll-triple-official-claims/", "published": "2020-08-03T00:00:00"}, {"title": "IDF Thwarts Attack by Syrian Cell that Entered Israeli Territory to Plant Bomb", "text": "A Syrian terror cell that infiltrated Israeli territory Monday to carry out an attack against a military post has been thwarted, the IDF said.\n\nThe four-member cell planted improvised explosive devices inside an unmanned Israel Defense Forces (IDF) outpost along the border with Syria.\n\n\u201cA short time ago, an IDF force foiled an attempt to place explosive devices along the border with Syria,\u201d the army said in a statement.\n\n\u201cSpecial forces that were carrying out an ambush near an IDF post in the southern Golan Heights spotted a cell with a number of terrorists planting explosive devices along the border.\u201d\n\nSoldiers from the Maglan special forces unit and aircraft opened synchronized fire on the four armed terrorists, killing them all, the army said.\n\nNo Israeli soldiers were injured.\n\nThe army is investigating the origin of the terror cell, IDF Spokesperson Hidai Zilberman said.

That amounts to 15 million newborns a year, of which 1 million will die. One million will suffer from disabilities due to preterm complications, putting a heavy burden on healthcare systems.\n\n\u201cWe want to revolutionize the current form of treatment to prevent preterm birth,\u201d CEO of PregnanTech, and senior obstetrician from Sheba Medical Center in Tel Hashomer Dr. David Shashar told the Jerusalem Post.\n\nThe device, called Lioness, is a disposable, patented silicone ring that is inserted vaginally, surrounding the uterine cervix and prevents early shortening or dilatation of the cervix even through uterine contractions. It does this by reducing the load on the cervix and intercepting the biomechanical cascade that leads to preterm birth.

The party that refuses to sacrifice its own creature comforts and material securities to ensure it walked the walk. So before you leave today, I want you to answer this question for yourselves: Which side of history is my party actually on?\n\nIn a call following her remarks, Cullors told Axios that she and other activists are \u201cplaying the long game\u201d and that \u201ceven if we get Trump out in November we will still be having this same conversation about police violence with Biden in office.\u201d\n\nCullors also added that earlier this month, the Movement for Black Lives (M4BL) policy team met with members of Biden\u2019s campaign to discuss the BREATHE Act.\n\nThe BREATHE Act:\n\nFormulated by the radical Movement for Black Lives (M4BL) \u2014 a coalition of more than 150 organizations and championed by Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) and Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) \u2014 the bill, posted on breatheact.org, is broken into four sections that focus on reforming federal institutions and policies.\n\nThe first section calls for moves such as divesting from police agencies like the DEA and ICE, dramatically reducing the Department of Defense budget, ending life sentences and mandatory minimum sentences, closing all federal prisons and immigration detention centers, and decriminalizing and retroactively expunging both state and federal drug offenses.\n\nThe second section calls for federal grants to incentivize local jurisdictions to decarcerate jails and/or defund police forces, close detention facilities, abolish state gang databases, remove police from schools, repeal all juvenile offenses, eliminate all court fees and forgive past debts.\n\nThe section also calls for a new program that would send trained civilian specialists, rather than police, to respond to 911 calls in order to reduce unnecessary contact between law enforcement and community members.\n\nThe next section calls for allocating new money for social equality in communities that provide equitable funding for all schools; developing school curricula that examines the impacts of colonialism, genocide against indigenous peoples and slavery; closing youth detention centers; and providing a lifetime of free access to education for undocumented immigrants, including those who are currently or were formerly incarcerated.\n\nThe final section calls for reparations for those incarcerated, including enfranchisement to vote; creating a public financing program for campaigns powered by small-dollar contributions; incentivizing states to increase voter turnout; and allowing undocumented immigrants to vote in local and state elections.\n\nBiden-Sanders unity task force on criminal justice reform:\n\nUnsurprisingly, many of the BREATHE Act\u2019s demands resemble recommendations made by the Biden-Sanders criminal justice task force.\n\nThe task force recommendations include ending the use of private prisons and detention centers \u2014 including for immigration offenses; ending cash bail; abolishing the death penalty at the federal level; making all sentencing reforms retroactive to allow for individualized resentencing; incentivizing jail and prison closures as populations decline; restoring the right to vote for all formerly incarcerated individuals; reinstating government-subsidized grants (Pell Grant eligibility) for previously incarcerated individuals; conditioning the receipt of federal funds on the automatic expungement and sealing of juvenile records; and federal funding to create a civilian corps of unarmed first responders such as social workers, EMTs, and trained mental health professionals to handle non-violent emergencies.\n\nBreitbart News previously reported that the task force on criminal justice reform, charged with shaping Biden\u2019s public policy agenda and intended to guide the party\u2019s 2020 platform, was composed of extremist members with radical views directly tied to organizations that believe America is inherently racist and must be fought through radical transformation.\n\nBiden, long seen as a moderate, has earned plaudits from progressives in recent weeks for the aggressive recommendations made by the Biden-Sanders unity task force.\n\n\u201cThe compromise they came up with, if implemented, will make Biden the most progressive president since FDR,\u201d Sanders told MSNBC after the task force released its recommendations.\n\nSanders added that there was a \u201creal honest effort\u201d to find a compromise between left-wing supporters of Sanders and establishment Biden backers.\n\nPatrisse Cullors radical revolution:\n\nBreitbart News previously reported on the M4BL and its extreme vision for what a \u201ctrue American revolution\u201d would look like, with Patrice Cullors warning the DNC platform committee that if the Democratic Party is not careful, they risk losing the great opportunity to lead our country.\n\nAs reported, the nationwide push led by Black Lives Matter to defund the police is part of a larger radical agenda expressed in the group\u2019s own manifesto which openly seeks a revolution to topple the U.S. capitalist system and its replacement with a socialist-style government replete with universal income, collective ownership, and the redistribution of wealth.\n\nAdditionally, Breitbart News documented Cullors \u2014 whom the DNC platform committee embraced \u2014 as the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of a communist-supporting domestic terrorist for over a decade, spending years training in political organizing and absorbing the radical Marxist-Leninist ideology which shaped her worldview.\n\nBiden embracing the revolution:\n\nOn Tuesday, Biden reiterated that he would be \u201cone of the most progressive presidents in U.S. history\u201d during a rare question-and-answer session with the press after a speech on racial equality in Wilmington, Delaware, as Breitbart News reported.\n\nBiden\u2019s promises of a fundamental transformation have been made on several occasions, including:\n\nMay 4: Biden calls coronavirus an \u201cincredible opportunity \u2026 to fundamentally transform the country.\u201d\n\nMay 11: Biden says America needs \u201crevolutionary institutional changes.\u201d\n\nJune 2: Biden calls for America to fight \u201csystemic racism.\u201d\n\nJuly 4: Biden promises to \u201ctransform\u201d America and \u201crip the roots of systemic racism out of this country.\u201d\n\nJuly 9: Biden vows he will put an \u201cend to the era of shareholder capitalism.\u201d\n\nJuly 13: Biden promises \u201csystemic\u201d and \u201cinstitutional\u201d changes.\n\nOn Friday, former congressman Phil Gramm noted in The Wall Street Journal that Biden had taken a hard left turn since securing his party\u2019s nomination, adopting the socialist agenda of former rivals Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.

Khalifa Haftar. The GNA is the Libyan government recognized by the United Nations, while the LNA has political leadership based in Tobruk and enjoys outside support from Russia, a few key Middle Eastern states, and some Europeans.\n\nOne of the most important criticism lobbed at the GNA by supporters of the LNA is that the Tripoli government is too friendly with Islamist extremists, an accusation the story told to the AP would appear to support.\n\nThe AP\u2019s sources said they were uncomfortable with how the deal for Turkish assistance was negotiated:\n\nSeveral officials say their side entered the deals with Turkey reluctantly, late last year, believing they had no choice. They desperately needed an ally as their opponent in the war, Libyan commander Khalifa Hafter, bore down on Tripoli with his forces, strengthened by Russian, Emirati, and Egyptian backing. \u201cIt was like a give-and-take game,\u201d said one official in Tripoli-based Prime Minister Fayez Sarraj\u2019s office. \u201cThey took advantage of our weakness at the time.\u201d He and other officials spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing for their safety in a country largely ruled by an array of militias. In the end, Turkey sent troops and thousands of Syrian mercenaries and other military support that helped pro-Sarraj forces repel Hafter\u2019s assault this spring, preventing the collapse of the Tripoli-based administration and shifting the tide of the war.\n\nThe Jerusalem Post bluntly accused Turkey of \u201cblackmailing\u201d the desperate GNA into accepting a lopsided deal for military assistance, which sent almost 4,000 jihadi fighters recruited from the brutal Syrian civil war to help push Haftar\u2019s forces back from Tripoli. Turkey also provided the GNA with weapons and training, including much-needed anti-aircraft systems.\n\nAt the same time, Turkey was reportedly blackmailing Europe to keep quiet by threatening to flood some of the countries that supported Haftar with a tidal wave of Syrian refugees.\n\nTurkey billed the GNA about $1.7 billion for its assistance and finally muscled Prime Minister Fayez Sarraj into accepting an offshore drilling deal Turkey had been pushing for the past year. Sarraj resisted in part because he was uncertain he had the authority to sign those maritime rights over to Turkey, and he knew doing so would enrage Egypt, Greece, Cyprus, Israel, and Europe\u2019s Mediterranean nations.\n\nSarraj\u2019s concerns were well-founded, as Greece and the European Union are strongly disputing the legitimacy of the offshore deal he made with Turkey. The EU called the deal a \u201cthreat to stability\u201d for the entire region. The United States has expressed support for Greece\u2019s position on the Mediterranean deal.\n\n\u201cIt was relentless pressure. Turkey was the only country that promised support, and we agreed only after all other doors were closed,\u201d a GNA official said of the negotiating process.\n\nThere have also been disputed reports that Turkey pressured the GNA into letting it build permanent military bases near Libya\u2019s \u201coil crescent,\u201d the oil-rich area bordering on Egypt. Egypt has threatened to invade Libya to keep Turkish forces and jihadi militia out of the border region and appears to be developing a military position in Syria from which it could bring forces to bear against the Turks if war breaks out in Libya.\n\nThe declared flashpoint for such a conflict is the Libyan city of Sirte, birthplace of late dictator Moammar Qaddafi and a strategic gateway to the oil crescent. Sirte is currently under the control of the LNA, but Turkish, militia and GNA forces have been moving into position for an attack. Egypt has described Sirte as its \u201cred line\u201d and said its fall would trigger military intervention.\n\nThe Jerusalem Post speculated Turkey might back down from Sirte since Turkey\u2019s adventure in Libya has united so many Arab powers against it, while tensions with Greece are nearing the breaking point. Greek officials will travel to Ankara next week to defuse those tensions. The JPost speculated that a reported offer from Turkey to sell drones to Greece could be intended as a peace offering.\n\nSome U.S. lawmakers are working on a bill that would apply sanctions against Russia and Turkey for intervening in Libya on opposite sides. The bill\u2019s sponsors are generally more concerned about Russia, which appears to be moving its \u201cmercenaries\u201d into position to seize control of Libya\u2019s oil industry.\n\nThere was some support in Washington for Haftar \u2014 a dual Libyan-American citizen who was an intelligence asset for the CIA during the Reagan years and owns property in Virginia \u2014 earlier in the conflict, but it soured as the warlord was accused of human rights violations, moved more decisively into Russia\u2019s orbit, and became \u201cridiculous and uncompromising,\u201d as one U.S. official put it. The current view is that Haftar and his Russian backers are the parties most likely to escalate the Libyan conflict and jeopardize the country\u2019s valuable oil resources.", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/07/31/libyan-officials-say-turkey-blackmailed-them-accepting-jihadi-troops/", "published": "2020-07-31T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Turkey Sends Fighters to Azerbaijan After Threat to Bomb Nuclear Plant", "text": "Turkey\u2019s state-run Anadolu news agency confirmed the arrival Turkish F-16 fighter jets on Friday to Azerbaijan for joint military drills, aiding a nation that threatened to bomb a nuclear power plant this month.\n\nAzerbaijan is currently embroiled in a heightened tension situation with its neighbor and longtime rival Armenia. Both have disputed the Nagorno-Karabakh border territory, legally under Azerbaijani command but claimed by Armenia because the population there is ethnically Armenian, for years. The current tensions follow a military skirmish elsewhere on the border, in the Tavush region, that occurred in early April, leaving 16 dead soldiers on both sides.\n\nIt remains unclear which side started the fighting that led to those deaths, but the government of Turkey immediately condemned Armenia for triggering the hostilities and stated it would offer any support Azerbaijan requested.\n\nOn Friday, Anadolu reported that Ankara and Baku had organized joint military drills featuring air exercises.\n\n\u201cTurkish F-16 fighter jets have arrived in Azerbaijan for joint military exercises, Azerbaijan\u2019s Defense Ministry said on Friday. In a statement, the ministry said the jets will take part in the TurAz Qartali-2020 Joint Exercises, which began on Wednesday,\u201d Anadolu reported. \u201cThe drill, involving jets and helicopters, will continue in the capital Baku as well as Nakhchivan, Ganja, Kurdamir, and Yevlakh until Aug. 10.\u201d\n\nAnadolu noted the context of the Tavush attack and revealed that, of the 16 killed, 11 were Azerbaijani soldiers, including a major general in the Azerbaijani army.\n\nOn Wednesday, Anadolu noted that the two states are also planning joint ground exercises next week, including \u201cartillery, armored vehicles, and mortars striking simulated targets.\u201d\n\nTurkey\u2019s increased involvement in Azerbaijan follows a threat from that country to bomb a nuclear power plant in the region, potentially causing millions of casualties. Armenia is home to the Metsamor Nuclear Power Plant, a poorly maintained relic of the Soviet era built near an earthquake fault. Following the Tavush incident, a spokesman for Azerbaijan\u2019s Defense Ministry threatened to destroy it.\n\n\u201cThe Armenian side must not forget that our army\u2019s state-of-the-art missile systems allow us to strike the Metsamor nuclear plant with precision, which could lead to a great catastrophe for Armenia,\u201d the spokesman, Vagif Dargahli, said. Turkey offered Azerbaijan air support shortly after this statement.\n\nThe Armenian government accused Azerbaijan of seeking a renewed genocide against Armenians, the victims of the first modern genocide.\n\n\u201cSuch threats are an explicit demonstration of state terrorism and genocidal intent of Azerbaijan,\u201d the Armenian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said. \u201cThe threats voiced by the Ministry of Defense of Azerbaijan to launch missile attacks at the Armenian Metsamor Nuclear Power Plant indicate the level of desperation and the crisis of mind of the political-military leadership of Azerbaijan.\u201d\n\nThe joint exercises with Turkey are occurring at a time in which there appears to be no active hostility on the Armenian-Azerbaijani border. On Friday, Armenia\u2019s Ministry of Defense certified that the situation was \u201crelatively calm,\u201d according to the Armenian outlet Hetq, by which Yerevan meant that gunfire did target Armenia, but no reported injuries occurred.\n\nOn Monday, however, Armenia accused Azerbaijan of breaking a temporary ceasefire between the two countries, killing an Armenian soldier.\n\n\u201cIt should be stressed that Azerbaijan resorted to this provocation few days after the statement issued by the OSCE Minsk Group Co-Chairs, which particularly emphasized the importance of strictly adhering to the ceasefire and refraining from provocative actions in this period,\u201d the Armenian Foreign Affairs Ministry asserted in a statement, referring to a group of European neighbors working to get both sides to dialogue.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, Azerbaijan announced joint large-scale military exercises to be held with Turkey. All these demonstrate that the leadership of Azerbaijan, through its provocative actions, is undermining the efforts of the international mediators aimed at de-escalating the situation and resuming the peace process, thus bearing the responsibility for the consequences of further destabilization,\u201d the Foreign Ministry denounced.\n\nA week before that incident, a spokeswoman for the Armenian Defense Ministry accused Azerbaijan of attacking Tavush once more and suffering what Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) called \u201cheavy casualties. Azerbaijan denied that any such incident occurred.\n\nTurkey enjoys positive relations with Baku for both ideological and ethnic reasons, as Azeris speak a Turkic language and are generally considered a Turkic people. Armenians, on the other hand, are ethnically distinct and majority Christian; the Kingdom of Armenia was the first state in human history to adopt Christianity as its religion.\n\nThe Ottoman Empire committed what is widely regarded as the first genocide of the modern era against the Armenian people \u2014 as well as other Christians such as Assyrians and Greeks \u2014 in the beginning of the 20th century, killing 1.5 of an estimated 2 million Armenians in the world. To this day, Turkey denies that its actions constituted genocide and alleges, contradicting most authoritative historical accounts, that the killing of Armenians and other Christians occurred in the context of war and that many Turks also died.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "link":

major ritual of the scaled-down hajj as Saudi authorities seek to prevent a coronavirus outbreak.\n\nMassive crowds in previous years triggered deadly stampedes during the ritual, but this year only up to 10,000 Muslims are taking part after millions of international pilgrims were barred.\n\nIn the scorching heat, worshippers made their way across Mina Valley near Mecca in western Saudi Arabia under the watchful eyes of security forces, to symbolically \u201chumiliate\u201d the devil.\n\nMasked pilgrims, clad in white and observing social distancing, threw seven stones each at a pillar symbolising Satan.\n\nHajj authorities offered the pilgrims pebbles that were sanitised to protect against the pandemic.\n\nFriday also marks the beginning of Eid al-Adha, the feast of sacrifice.\n\nMuslims traditionally slaughter sheep for the three-day holiday in tribute to the Prophet Abraham\u2019s sacrifice of a lamb after God at the last moment spared Ishmael, his son.\n\nTraditionally they consume some of the meat and give the rest to the poor.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Dream come true\u2019 \u2013\n\nLast year, Saudi Arabia\u2019s King Salman made the trip to Mina and was seen on state-run television observing worshippers from the window of a high-rise.\n\nBut it was unclear whether he would visit this year.\n\nThe kingdom\u2019s 84-year-old ruler left a Riyadh hospital on Thursday, authorities said, after a 10-day stay where he underwent surgery to remove his gall bladder.\n\nThe hajj, one of the five pillars of Islam and a must for able-bodied Muslims at least once in their lifetime, is usually one of the world\u2019s largest religious gatherings.\n\nBut local media said up to 10,000 people already residing in the kingdom are participating in this year\u2019s ritual, compared with 2019\u2019s gathering of some 2.5 million from around the world.\n\nThe hajj ministry had initially said around 1,000 pilgrims will be allowed.\n\nOn Thursday, pilgrims scaled Mount Arafat for Koran recitals and prayers to atone for their sins in what is seen as the high point of the hajj.\n\n\u201cI am so happy to be chosen among millions for the hajj this year,\u201d Saudi pilgrim Wedyan Alwah said before setting off on the climb.\n\n\u201cMy lifetime dream has come true.\u201d\n\nThey made their way down Mount Arafat to Muzdalifah, another holy site, where they spent the night before the stoning ritual.\n\nIn previous years, the ritual was not without risk as millions of pilgrims converge on a tight space and the pebbles often miss their mark.\n\nRiyadh faced strong criticism in 2015 when some 2,300 worshippers were crushed, trampled or suffocated in Mina in the deadliest stampede in the gathering\u2019s history.\n\nAuthorities have since reinforced safety and security measures.\n\n\u2013 Health precautions \u2013\n\nAfter the stoning ritual, pilgrims will return to the Grand Mosque in Mecca to perform a final \u201ctawaf\u201d or circling of the Kaaba.\n\nThe Kaaba, the focal point of Islam, is a cube structure towards which Muslims around the world pray.\n\nIt is draped in a black cloth embroidered in gold with Koranic verses and known as the kiswa, which is changed each year during the pilgrimage.\n\nThe hajj began on Wednesday when pilgrims were brought inside the mosque in small batches.\n\nThey walked along socially distanced paths marked on the floor, in sharp contrast to the normal sea of humanity that swirls around the Kaaba during hajj.\n\nThe pilgrims, who have all been tested for the virus, and were required to be quarantined before the hajj and are to be quarantined again afterwards, authorities said.\n\n\u201cHealth precautions have been thoroughly and meticulously implemented in all stages\u201d to protect against the pandemic, Hussein al-Sharif, a senior hajj official was quoted as saying by the media ministry.\n\nThe hajj typically costs thousands of dollars for pilgrims, who

In recent weeks, the man known as El Marro went on the run after authorities arrested his parents and relatives in a series of raids. As Breitbart Texas reported at the time, a tearful El Marro sent out a video threatening an all-out war for having touched his family.\n\nCSRL actively fought with Mexico\u2019s Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generacion for control of Guanajuato and the region\u2019s underground fuel market. The fighting between the two organizations led to numerous mass killings and gruesome executions. Unlike other criminal organizations,CSRL is primarily involved in the large-scale theft of fuel rather than drug trafficking. However, the criminal organization made a name as one of Mexico\u2019s most violent organizations. The group is linked to the regular use of explosives in their attacks.\n\nIldefonso Ortiz is an award-winning journalist with Breitbart Texas.

The gunmen are expected to undergo their trial in state court, however, authorities also provided the information to their federal counterparts.\n\nA few days before, three other gunmen also believed to be tied with the CDN-Los Zetas were arrested. The case took place in mid-July in the Gobernadores neighborhood when a squad of Coahuila state officers raided a home and arrested two men and a woman possessing tactical gear, uniforms, and six AK-47 rifles.\n\nThe recent arrests are tied to an investigation into the CDN-Los Zetas following a terrorist-style attack in November 2019, when approximately 150 gunmen from Nuevo Laredo raided the town of Villa Union in Coahuila.

The superseding indictment adds Luis Cardenas Palomino and Ramon Pequeno Garcia to three of the five criminal charges initially filed against Garcia Luna. Both Cardenas and Pequeno are not in federal custody and are believed to be in Mexico, while Garcia Luna has been in U.S. custody since his arrest in December 2019.\n\nThe superseding indictment claims that all three former cops took millions in bribes from the Sinaloa Cartel in exchange for not interfering with drug shipments. The former cops also allegedly leaked sensitive information about investigations. The indictment also alleges the officers would target Sinaloa Cartel rivals for arrest to thin the competition.\n\nIn December, federal authorities arrested Garcia Luna on several international drug trafficking conspiracy and bribery charges. The allegations against Garcia Luna first surfaced through witness testimony in the highly publicized trial of Sinaloa Cartel boss Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzman.

It is hard to believe that it has been more than 20 years since it first came out, because I can still remember it very vividly. In one of the most memorable scenes in the film, a massive tsunami that is hundreds of feet tall slams into the east coast of the United States causing immense death and destruction.\n\nBut that is just a movie. Could something similar actually happen in real life?\n\nOn Tuesday, a British news source reminded us that scientists have discovered that such a scenario is actually a very real possibility\u2026\n\nA computer simulation of an asteroid impact tsunami developed by scientists at the University of California, Santa Cruz (USCS), showed waves as high as 400 feet sweeping onto the Atlantic Coast of the US. Steven Ward, a researcher at the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics at UCSC, and Erik Asphaug, an associate professor of Earth sciences, reported their findings in the Geophysical Journal International.\n\nOf course an asteroid could potentially hit anywhere on the planet, but in their research Ward and Asphaug specifically focused on the Atlantic Ocean, and what their computer simulation came up with was extremely disconcerting\u2026\n\nFor the simulation, the researchers chose an impact site consistent with the orientation of the Earth at the time of the predicted encounter \u2013 in the Atlantic Ocean about 360 miles from the US coast. Dr Ward explained that the 60,000-megaton blast of the impact could vaporise the asteroid and blow a cavity in the ocean 11 miles across and all the way down to the seafloor, which is about three miles deep at that point.\n\nSuch an impact would send a series of giant waves in all directions, including toward the east coast of the United States.\n\nToday, almost 40 percent of the U.S. population lives in a county that directly borders a shoreline, and the population density right along the east coast is particularly dense.\n\nFlorida would probably be the first state to get hit by the waves, and it would be particularly vulnerable because most of the state is just barely above sea level\u2026\n\nSouth Florida has two big problems. The first is its remarkably flat topography. Half the area that surrounds Miami is less than five feet above sea level. Its highest natural elevation, a limestone ridge that runs from Palm Beach to just south of the city, averages a scant 12 feet. With just three feet of sea-level rise, more than a third of southern Florida will vanish; at six feet, more than half will be gone; if the seas rise 12 feet, South Florida will be little more than an isolated archipelago surrounded by abandoned buildings and crumbling overpasses. And the waters won\u2019t just come in from the east \u2013 because the region is so flat, rising seas will come in nearly as fast from the west too, through the Everglades.\n\nIn other words, there would be absolutely nothing to keep the tsunami waves from racing across the entire state.\n\nMuch of the rest of the east coast would be extremely vulnerable as well. For example, New York City is less than 50 feet above sea level\u2026\n\nDespite having some of the tallest buildings in the world and being well-known for its towers and skyscrapers, New York City has a very low elevation of just 33 feet (10 m) above sea level. New York\u2019s elevation is so low due to its location right on the coast of the United States.\n\nBoston, New Haven, Jersey City, Newark, Atlantic City, Philadelphia, Virginia Beach, Wilmington, Myrtle Beach, Charleston, Savannah and countless other east coast cities are all also less than 50 feet above sea level.\n\nSo we are talking about the potential for death and destruction on a scale that is unimaginable.\n\nWashington D.C. would fare a little bit better, because some parts of the D.C. area are up to 410 feet above sea level\u2026\n\nWashington D.C. is relatively flat and located at 410 feet above sea level at its highest point and at sea level at its lowest point.\n\nSo I would rather be in D.C. than New York or Boston when a giant tsunami hits, but without a doubt the devastation would be immense in our capital city as well.\n\nWe should hope that such an event can be put off for as long as possible, but we have been warned that our planet is apparently \u201cin the midst of an epic asteroid surge\u201d\u2026\n\nAnd as I noted at the beginning of this article, we are still discovering more asteroids all the time. The one that was discovered on July 26th was not a threat, but it did come alarmingly close to us\u2026\n\nA car-sized asteroid discovered over the weekend made a close flyby of Earth today (July 28), passing our planet at a range that rivals the orbits of some high-flying satellites. The asteroid 2020 OY4, which was first detected on Sunday (July 26), made its closest approach today at 1:31 a.m. EDT (0531 GMT) when it zipped by Earth at a speed of about 27,700 mph (44,600 km/h), according to the European Space Agency. The asteroid is just under 10 feet (3 meters) wide and posed no impact risk to Earth, but did approach the flight paths of geosynchronous satellites.\n\nDespite all of our advanced technology, we remain extremely vulnerable, and scientists assure us that it is just a matter of time before our luck runs out and a gigantic space rock hits our planet.\n\nThe good news is that we do not currently know about any asteroids that appear to be an imminent threat.\n\nBut of course the bad news is that there are plenty of asteroids that we still haven\u2019t discovered yet, and one or more of them could possibly be traveling directly toward us.\n\nThe Reopen America Back to School Special is now live!

The asteroid is just under 10 feet (3 meters) wide and posed no impact risk to Earth, but did approach the flight paths of geosynchronous satellites.\n\nDespite all of our advanced technology, we remain extremely vulnerable, and scientists assure us that it is just a matter of time before our luck runs out and a gigantic space rock hits our planet.\n\nThe good news is that we do not currently know about any asteroids that appear to be an imminent threat.\n\nBut of course the bad news is that there are plenty of asteroids that we still haven\u2019t discovered yet, and one or more of them could possibly be traveling directly toward us.\n\nThe Reopen America Back to School Special is now live!

The second blast sent an enormous orange fireball into the sky, flattened the harbourside and drove a tornado-like shockwave through the city, shattering windows kilometres (miles) away.\n\nIt is being reported that Beirut\u2019s port \u201cis totally destroyed\u201d, and this comes at a really bad time because Lebanon is already in the midst of an epic economic collapse.\n\nIn recent months, we have become accustomed to hearing about \u201cmystery explosions\u201d all over the Middle East, and many believe that those mystery explosions indicate that the region is on the brink of a full-blown war.\n\nBut this incident was different. A large section of the capital of Lebanon has been flattened, and many eyewitnesses are comparing the blast to a nuclear explosion. Here is one example\u2026\n\n\u201cIt was like an atomic bomb,\u201d said Makrouhie Yerganian, a retired schoolteacher in her mid-70s who has lived near the port for decades. \u201cI\u2019ve experienced everything, but nothing like this before,\u201d even during the country\u2019s 1975-1990 civil war, she said. \u201cAll the buildings around here have collapsed.\u201d\n\nAnd even Beirut Governor Marwan Aboud brought up \u201cHiroshima\u201d and \u201cNagasaki\u201d when asked about the explosion\u2026\n\n\u201cThis reminds me of what happened in Hiroshima and Nagasaki,\u201d said Beirut Governor Marwan Aboud. \u201cI have never seen such widespread destruction.

Defense Minister Benny Gantz and Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi, on behalf of the State of Israel, have offered the Lebanese government \u2013 via international intermediaries \u2013 medical and humanitarian aid, as well as immediate emergency assistance,\u2019 said a joint statement from the two ministries.\n\nIf Israel really had been behind this attack, I seriously doubt that they would be offering to patch up their enemies.\n\nAnd this isn\u2019t Israel\u2019s style either.

Local media are reporting that 2,700 tonnes of the chemical exploded, which scientists making initial calculations said was about three kilotonnes of TNT \u2013 roughly a fifth of the Little Boy atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in the Second World War.\n\nBut Donald Trump is apparently not buying that explanation. He told the press that the explosion \u201cwas an attack\u201d and that it was caused by \u201ca bomb of some kind\u201d\u2026\n\nAt least 60 people were killed and thousands were wounded in an explosion that caused widespread damage in the Lebanese capital. Trump said he had been briefed by \u201cour great generals\u201d and that they \u201cseem to feel\u201d that the explosion was not an accident. \u201cAccording to them \u2013 they would know better than I would \u2013 but they seem to think it was an attack,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House. \u201cIt was a bomb of some kind.\u201d\n\nIf this really was an attack, the Lebanese are going to want revenge, because a substantial portion of their capital city has been absolutely decimated.\n\nAnd needless to say, there are already voices all over the Middle East that are eagerly pointing a finger of blame at Israel and are calling for war.\n\nBut unlike the \u201cmystery explosions\u201d that have been happening in Iran, the evidence does not indicate that Israel had anything to do with this great tragedy.\n\nUnfortunately, a lot of people out there are going to jump to their own conclusions, and many of those that hate Israel will use this as another justification to call for armed conflict.\n\nOver the past couple of years, there have been so many moments when it seemed like a major war could break out at any time in the Middle East.

It is, however, my contention that examining the inflationary policies pursued by central banks and governments are fundamental to understanding how the current corona hysteria developed.\n\nCalling it hysteria may sound harsh. When the coronavirus first started to draw attention back in February, and when most Western countries instituted extremely restrictive measures in March, one could make a plausible argument that the world was dealing with an unknown and seemingly catastrophic disease and that therefore extreme measures were justified. To be sure, this does not mean that the measures implemented were in any way effective, nor that the sacrifices imposed were morally justified; but there was at least an argument to be made.\n\nAt this point in time, however, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has repeatedly cut the COVID-19 fatality rate, and it is now comparable to a bad year of the seasonal flu (see the useful aggregation of studies and reports by Swiss Propaganda Research). The glaring question therefore is: Why do governments across the West act as if they were still dealing with an unprecedented threat? It is no good to simply reply that what politicians really want is power and that they are just using coronavirus as an excuse for extending government control. While a plausible claim, it does not explain why vast majorities in most countries support whatever policies their rulers have thought good. Given the extreme restrictions placed on social and economic life and the mendacious, ever shifting narrative used to justify them, one would think that there would be widespread opposition after four months. So why is there practically none?\n\nInflation in the Age of Corona\n\nWe can better understand this strange phenomenon if we consider the inflationary policies pursued by central banks across the world. I\u2019ll here cleave to the old definition of the term inflation and the one still favored by Austrian school economists: an increase in the quantity of money. The rise in prices which is commonly referred to as inflation is simply the effect of such an increase. While the complexities of modern central banking can sometimes obscure the realities of the process, there can be no doubt that the last couple of months have seen very high levels of inflation.\n\nModern central banks are no longer content with the classic role of lender of last resort. As the financial system has evolved, central banks have assumed the role of market maker of last resort\u2014that is, they have either implicitly or explicitly assumed the responsibility of making sure that there is always a buyer for financial assets\u2014and first of all government bonds. Thus the Federal Reserve\u2019s balance sheet has ballooned from just over $4 trillion at the beginning of March to now just below $7 trillion; the Bank of England\u2019s has increased from about \u00a3580 billion in March to about \u00a3780 billion; and the European Central Bank has increased its holdings from about \u20ac4.6 trillion to about \u20ac6.3 trillion. The balance sheets of the largest central banks thus expanded by between 35 and 75 percent in about five months.\n\nInflated central bank balance sheets suggest inflation is coming, but actual inflation of the money supply naturally lags behind, since central bank purchases of bonds and securities do not necessarily result in an immediate expansion of the stock of money. The American money stock (measured by the monetary aggregate M2) grew from $15.5 trillion to $18.4 trillion (March\u2013July 13), the British one from \u00a32.45 trillion to about \u00a32.67 trillion (January\u2013May) and the euro area money stock from \u20ac12.4 trillion to almost \u20ac13.2 trillion (January\u2013June). The annualized rates of inflation in the major monetary areas during the corona episode is then between about 13 (eurozone) and about 50 (USA) percent, well above the norm. If we look at the Austrian, \u201ctrue\u201d measure of the money supply (TMS) for the United States, we see a similar picture, as the TMS in June grew 34.5 percent year over year (YOY).\n\nThe Effects of the Present Inflation\n\nInflation is not an act of God; it is the outcome of a determined policy on the part of governments and central banks. Such a policy has both long-run and short-run effects, which brings us to the first and most obvious way in which inflation has fueled corona hysteria: by essentially putting freshly printed money at the disposal of governments, these latter have been able to first shut down their countries and then pose as saviors as they distributed largesse to workers and businesses. The states have often reimbursed the costs of furloughing employees, either directly or through (sometimes forgivable) loans to companies, or they have distributed generous unemployment benefits to the workers. This, and not any economic collapse, is the story behind the unprecedented spike in unemployment claims in the United States. The central bank has also created facilities to lend to municipal governments and the Main Street Lending Program to \u201csupport lending to small and medium-sized businesses and nonprofit organizations that were in sound financial condition before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d\n\nThe effect of these programs and policies and others like them in other countries has been to mitigate the direct impact of government-imposed shutdowns. Businesses may have no revenues, but government aid and loans allow them to meet their contractual payments; workers may be unemployed, but generous unemployment subsidies allow them to maintain themselves comfortably; government support of furloughing schemes hides the true extent of unemployment caused by the shutdowns. And all this seemingly at no cost, since no one notices the inevitable dilution of the purchasing power of the monetary unit.\n\nIn the absence of these inflationary policies, the consequences of the shutdown would be much more immediately apparent. Workers would have to spend out of their saved cash and liquidate their savings, while businesses earning no revenues would start to default on their contractual payments. A drastic fall in the prices of real and financial assets would have resulted. The pressure to end the restrictions would have been much stronger. Instead, it looks to most people as if they can go on at their old standard of living indefinitely\u2014or at least as long as they continue to receive their government checks. The economic effects of the shutdown are still the same, however: dislocation of the production structure and capital consumption on a vast scale, but these have been hidden\u2014papered over by inflation and government support.\n\nTo the individual business owner and worker, the economic reality is hidden. Inflation leads to a fundamental disconnect with reality. Paul Cantor has previously described \u201cthe web of illusions endemic to the era of paper money\u201d and how inflation destroys people\u2019s sense of reality. In our case, inflationary monetary policy has hidden the costs of engaging in pandemic hysteria, and hence people do not\u2014indeed, cannot\u2014take account of economic realities when assessing the coronavirus and the shutdowns. Governments at all levels can continue to pose as saviors, inventing new mandates and restrictions to combat the nonexistent threat. Germophobes and busybodies can obsess over other people trying to go about their normal lives, since both the costs to them personally and to society as a whole are completely hidden. How many Karens would have the time to boss peaceful citizens around if they had to actually work to earn a living?\n\nEventually and pretty quickly, these policies will result in price inflation and a hollowing out of the standard of living. Not only has production been severely restricted, as seen in the drastic fall in US GDP figures; insofar as the newly printed money is used on unemployment compensation in different forms, it will quickly reach normal consumers and be spent on consumer goods. If the programs go on much longer, consumer price inflation, as a result of the fiat money inflation, cannot be far off. Once that happens, only increased rates of inflation can keep the programs going\u2014for a time.\n\nThe Effects of the Inflationary System\n\nThe effects of the inflationary system as such are much more far-reaching than economic dislocation and destruction, however. Fiat money produced out of thin air by central bankers leads to a long-run change in social attitudes and personal character. Joseph Salerno in a stimulating paper discusses how hyperinflation leads to the destruction of personality, and following Guido H\u00fclsmann,\n\nI would argue that fiat inflation entails the erosion of culture and character. This is perhaps most fully in evidence in Japan, where people have suffered under artificially low interest rates for decades. What are some of the consequences of an inflationary fiat standard and the culture it brings about, and what is the connection to the corona crisis? There is first of all a change in time preferences, as inflation leads to repressed interest rates and hence less incentive to save and invest. People\u2019s time horizons change, as they increasingly discount long-run value creation and instead focus on present enjoyments and short-run yields. The changing role of central banks only intensifies this development. Instead of \u201clenders of last resort,\u201d central banks are now \u201cmarket makers of last resort.\u201d That is to say, stock markets and bond prices cannot be allowed to fall, and it is the role of the banks to make sure they don\u2019t. As a consequence, investors increasingly turn to the pursuit of short-run yields.\n\nThis change in time preference has effects beyond the market. Since a premium is placed on short-term thinking in market affairs, naturally people transfer the same attitude to their nonmarket pursuits. Present benefits and present dangers are both emphasized at the expense of future costs and benefits, respectively. It is not hard to see the connection to the virus: since there is a possibility that the virus may potentially be very dangerous, people get frightened and act to make the fear go away. No matter the future consequences of their actions, the present danger of the virus trumps all.\n\nClosely connected to this change in time preferences is a skewed perception of reality. Inflation alters what constitutes successful action, since it is increasingly no longer productive endeavors but closeness to the source of inflation that determines the individual\u2019s success in life. Since the ability of the central banks to create paper wealth seems virtually boundless, naturally people come to have unrealistic expectations of what is possible. Of course we can have a shutdown. We\u2019ll have a central bank\u2013fueled \u201cv-shaped\u201d recovery once it\u2019s over. Of course governments can and should do whatever it takes to protect us from the virus. They can just finance spending with paper money for however long it takes. Whatever costs there are to these courses of action are hidden or far in the future.\n\nConclusion\n\nThere are many reasons for the corona crisis and the present almost total government control of the economy and society. But if we want to understand why states across the Western world have met virtually no resistance in their quest for power, we need to understand the role of inflation in enabling governments: directly through hiding the real costs and pain of the shutdowns, but also more fundamentally by distorting culture and personal character.\n\nThe Reopen America Back to School Special is now live!

It is held that increases or decreases in demand are behind the rises and declines in the economy\u2019s production of goods and services. It is also held that the overall economy\u2019s output increases by a multiple of the increase in expenditure by government, consumers, or businesses.\n\nAn example will illustrate how an initial bout of spending raises the overall output by a multiple of this spending. Let us assume that of an additional dollar received individuals spend $0.9 and save $0.1. Let us also assume that consumers have increased their expenditure by $100 million. Because of this, retailers\u2019 revenue rises by $100 million. Retailers, in response to this increase in their income, also consume 90 percent of the $100 million, i.e., they raise their expenditure on goods and services by $90 million. The recipients of these $90 million in turn spend 90 percent of the $90 million, i.e., $81 million. Then the recipients of the $81 million spend 90 percent of this sum, which is $72.9 million, and so on (note that the key in this way of thinking is that expenditure by one person becomes the income of another person). At each stage in the spending chain, people spend 90 percent of the additional income they receive. This process eventually ends, so it is held, with total output higher by $1 billion (10 x $100 million) than it was before consumers increased their initial expenditure by $100 million (the multiplier here is 10).\n\nObserve that the more is being spent from additional income, the greater the multiplier is and therefore the larger the impact of the initial spending on overall output is. For instance, if people change their habits and spend 95 percent of each dollar, the multiplier will become 20. Conversely, if they decide to spend only 80 percent and save 20 percent, then the multiplier will be 5. All this means that the less that is being saved, the larger will be the impact of an increase in overall demand on overall output.\n\nThe popularizer of the magical power of the multiplier, John Maynard Keynes, wrote,\n\nIf the Treasury were to fill old bottles with banknotes, bury them at suitable depths in disused coal mines which are then filled up to the surface with town rubbish, and leave it to private enterprise on well-tried principles of laissez-faire to dig the notes up again (the right to do so being obtained, of course by tendering for leases of the note-bearing territory), there need be no more unemployment and with the help of the repercussions, the real income of the community, and its capital wealth also, would probably become a good deal greater than it actually is.\n\nMoney and the Multiplier\n\nObserve that in the example above the initial boost to consumption had to originate somewhere. As a rule, the source is normally the monetary pumping of the central bank. Money, however, cannot set in motion a real economic boost. If this were the case, all third world economies would have erased poverty a long time ago.\n\nMoney enables the exchange of something for money and then the exchange of money for something else. In this sense, it is a medium of exchange, not the medium of payments. Paraphrasing Jean Baptiste Say, Mises argued that,\n\nCommodities, says Say, are ultimately paid for not by money, but by other commodities. Money is merely the commonly used medium of exchange; it plays only an intermediary role. What the seller wants ultimately to receive in exchange for the commodities sold is other commodities.\n\nWhen an individual increases his spending by $100 all it means is that he has lowered his demand for money by $100. The seller of goods has now acquired $100, which he can employ when he deems necessary. We can also say that the seller\u2019s demand for money has increased by $100. Likewise, if the seller then spent 90 percent of $100, all that we would have is a situation wherein his demand for money has fallen by $90 while somebody else\u2019s demand for money has risen by $90.\n\nIn addition, all other things being equal, if individuals have increased their expenditure on some goods, they will be forced to spend less on other goods. This means that the overall spending in an economy remains unchanged.\n\nOnly if the amount of money in the economy increases, all other things being equal, will spending in monetary terms follow suit. The increase in monetary expenditure as a result of an increase in money supply cannot, however, produce an expansion in real output, as the popular story has it.\n\nAll that it will generate is a reshuffling of the existent pool of real savings. It will enrich the early receivers of the new money at the expense of the last receivers, or those who do not receive it at all. Obviously, then, a loose monetary policy aimed at boosting consumers\u2019 demand cannot boost real output by a multiple of the initial increase in consumer demand. Not only will easy money policy not lift production, but, on the contrary, it will impoverish wealth generators.\n\nAre More Savings Bad for the Economy?\n\nCan more savings be bad for the economy as Keynesian economics suggests? Take, for instance, Bob the farmer, who has produced twenty tomatoes and consumes five. Fifteen saved tomatoes are left at his disposal\u2014these are his real savings. With the help of the saved tomatoes, Bob can now secure various other goods. For instance, he secures one loaf of bread from John the baker by paying him five tomatoes. Bob also buys a pair of shoes from Paul the shoemaker for ten tomatoes. Note that it is the real savings at his disposal that limit the amount of consumer goods Bob can secure for himself. Bob\u2019s purchasing power is constrained by the amount of real savings\u2014the tomatoes at his disposal\u2014all other things being equal. (Likewise, John the baker has produced ten loaves of bread and consumes two, making eight loaves his real savings. Equally, if out of the production of two pairs of shoes Paul keeps one pair for himself, then his real savings is one pair of shoes.)\n\nWhen Bob the farmer exercises his demand for one loaf of bread and one pair of shoes, he is transferring five tomatoes to John the baker and ten tomatoes to Paul the shoemaker. Bob\u2019s saved tomatoes maintain and enhance the baker\u2019s and shoemaker\u2019s lives and well-being. Likewise, the saved loaf of bread and the saved pair of shoes maintain Bob the farmer\u2019s life and well-being. Note that it is saved final consumer goods that sustain the baker, the farmer, and the shoemaker. They are what makes it possible to keep the flow of production going.\n\nThe owners of final consumer goods, rather than exchanging them for other consumer goods, could decide to invest them to secure better tools and machinery. Better tools and machinery can improve their productivity, leading to a greater output and better quality of consumer goods that will be produced sometime in the future.\n\nBy exchanging a portion of their saved consumer goods for tools and machinery, the owners of consumer goods are in fact transferring their real savings to individuals who specialize in making them. These individuals\u2019 own real savings sustain them while they are busy manufacturing tools and machinery.\n\nOnce these tools and machinery are built, they permit an increase in the production of consumer goods. As the flow of production expands, it permits more savings, all other things being equal, which in turn permit a further increase in the production of tools and machinery. This, in tur,n makes it possible to further increase the production of consumer goods, i.e., raise the purchasing power in the economy. So, contrary to popular thinking, more savings actually expand, not contract, the production flow of consumer goods.\n\nCan an increase in the demand for consumer goods lead to an increase in the overall output by the multiple of the increase in demand? To be able to accommodate his increased demand for goods, the baker must have a means of payment\u2014bread to pay for goods and services that he desires. Once the supply of consumer goods has increased, this permits an increase in demand for goods. The baker\u2019s increase in bread production permits him to increase his demand for other goods. In this sense, the increase in production gives rise to more demand for goods. People are engaged in production in order to be able to exercise demand for goods to maintain their well-being.\n\nWhat enables the expansion in the supply of final consumer goods is an increase in capital goods, or tools and machinery, and it is real savings that permit the increase in tools and machinery. We can thus infer that an increase in consumption must be in line with the increase in the production of final consumer goods. From this we can also deduce that consumption does not cause the production to increase by the multiple of the increase in consumption. Increases in production are in accordance with what the pool of real savings permits and are not constrained by consumers\u2019 demand. Production cannot expand without support from the pool of real savings, i.e., something cannot emerge out of nothing.\n\nIncreased Government Demand and Economic Growth\n\nLet us examine the effect of an increase in the government\u2019s demand on an economy\u2019s overall output. In an economy that is comprised of a baker, a shoemaker, and a tomato grower, another individual enters the scene. This individual is an enforcer who is exercising his demand for goods by means of force.\n\nCan such demand give rise to more output, as popular thinking has it? On the contrary, it will impoverish the producers. The baker, the shoemaker, and the farmer will be forced to part with their products in for nothing and this in turn will weaken the production of final consumer goods. Again, as one can see, not only does the increase in government outlays not raise overall output by a positive multiple. On the contrary, it leads to the weakening of the process of wealth generation in general. According to Mises,\n\nthere is need to emphasize the truism that a government can spend or invest only what it takes away from its citizens and that its additional spending and investment curtails the citizens\u2019 spending and investment to the full extent of its quantity.\n\nSummary and Conclusion\n\nJohn Maynard Keynes\u2019s writings remain as influential today as they were ninety years ago. His ideas remain the driving force of economic policymakers at the Fed and government institutions. These ideas permeate the thinking and writings of the most influential economists on Wall Street and in academia.\n\nThe heart of the Keynesian philosophy is that what drives the economy is demand for goods. Economic recessions are predominantly the result of insufficient demand. In the Keynesian framework, an increase in demand not only lifts overall output, but increases it by the multiple of the initial increase in demand. Something can be created out of nothing.\n\nIn the real world, an artificial boost in demand that is not supported by production leads to the dilution of the pool of real savings and, contrary to the Keynesian view, to a shrinking in the flow of real wealth. It results in economic impoverishment.\n\nThe Reopen America Back to School Special is now live!

It is held that increases or decreases in demand are behind the rises and declines in the economy\u2019s production of goods and services. It is also held that the overall economy\u2019s output increases by a multiple of the increase in expenditure by government, consumers, or businesses.\n\nAn example will illustrate how an initial bout of spending raises the overall output by a multiple of this spending. Let us assume that of an additional dollar received individuals spend $0.9 and save $0.1. Let us also assume that consumers have increased their expenditure by $100 million. Because of this, retailers\u2019 revenue rises by $100 million. Retailers, in response to this increase in their income, also consume 90 percent of the $100 million, i.e., they raise their expenditure on goods and services by $90 million. The recipients of these $90 million in turn spend 90 percent of the $90 million, i.e., $81 million. Then the recipients of the $81 million spend 90 percent of this sum, which is $72.9 million, and so on (note that the key in this way of thinking is that expenditure by one person becomes the income of another person). At each stage in the spending chain, people spend 90 percent of the additional income they receive. This process eventually ends, so it is held, with total output higher by $1 billion (10 x $100 million) than it was before consumers increased their initial expenditure by $100 million (the multiplier here is 10).\n\nObserve that the more is being spent from additional income, the greater the multiplier is and therefore the larger the impact of the initial spending on overall output is. For instance, if people change their habits and spend 95 percent of each dollar, the multiplier will become 20. Conversely, if they decide to spend only 80 percent and save 20 percent, then the multiplier will be 5. All this means that the less that is being saved, the larger will be the impact of an increase in overall demand on overall output.\n\nThe popularizer of the magical power of the multiplier, John Maynard Keynes, wrote,\n\nIf the Treasury were to fill old bottles with banknotes, bury them at suitable depths in disused coal mines which are then filled up to the surface with town rubbish, and leave it to private enterprise on well-tried principles of laissez-faire to dig the notes up again (the right to do so being obtained, of course by tendering for leases of the note-bearing territory), there need be no more unemployment and with the help of the repercussions, the real income of the community, and its capital wealth also, would probably become a good deal greater than it actually is.\n\nMoney and the Multiplier\n\nObserve that in the example above the initial boost to consumption had to originate somewhere. As a rule, the source is normally the monetary pumping of the central bank. Money, however, cannot set in motion a real economic boost. If this were the case, all third world economies would have erased poverty a long time ago.\n\nMoney enables the exchange of something for money and then the exchange of money for something else. In this sense, it is a medium of exchange, not the medium of payments. Paraphrasing Jean Baptiste Say, Mises argued that,\n\nCommodities, says Say, are ultimately paid for not by money, but by other commodities. Money is merely the commonly used medium of exchange; it plays only an intermediary role.

The Quran burning will take place on 28 August near a mosque in Malm\u00f6's immigrant heavy Roseng\u00e5rd district.\n\nPaludan described the action as \u201cstanding up for his brotherly people\u201d in Sweden.\n\n\u201cOur Swedish brothers are being exterminated in their own country, so the least we can do to help them is to show up in one of their occupied enclaves and tell our honest opinion about the Quran\u201d, Paludan said in a statement. \u201cThe Quran will burn in Roseng\u00e5rd\u201d, the party wrote.\n\nWhile Hard Line barely missed the threshold to enter parliament, Paludan has made himself known for burning Qurans across Denmark's immigrant quarters, which he sees as exercising his right to free speech and freedom of religion. In doing so, he has survived several attacks and assassination attempts.\n\nVideos of the subsequent confrontations are often shared on social media, where his party enjoys a substantial following.

He also made a parody commercial for clothing giant H&M with killer John Ausonius as a model.\n\nPark himself insists that his works are not a display of racism or hate, but rather sarcastic commentary on current events and against political correctness in Sweden.

Furgal was arrested last month, flown to Moscow and charged in connected with four murders in 2004 and 2005 \u2014 allegations that Putin\u2019s opponents decry as a sham. Furgal denies the charges.\n\nSince early July, thousands of protesters in Khabarovsk have joined daily, leaderless marches supporting the now-fired Furgal and calling for Putin to go \u2014 the sharpest regional challenge to Putin\u2019s 20-year rule as president and prime minister.\n\nKhabarovsk has been a thorn in Putin\u2019s side before. It was the only region where his United Russia party lost its dominance in regional elections in September, winning just two seats in the local legislature. Then, in a nationwide vote last month on constitutional amendments that paved the way for Putin to govern until 2036, Khabarovsk had one of the lowest turnouts in the nation, just 44 percent compared with the national average of 68 percent.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Khabarovsk protests have sparked recent small rallies in support of Khabarovsk in some other cities, including Moscow and Saint Petersburg, easily dispersed by riot police. But they send an alarming message to the Kremlin at a challenging time for Putin. The economy is battered by falling oil prices and the pandemic, and there is no clear path for authorities to re-energize Putin\u2019s image.\n\nRussia's political game\n\nThe Khabarovsk crisis also reveals some of the cracks in Russia\u2019s tightly managed authoritarian state, where co-opted opposition parties buy into the system by providing a veneer of pluralistic politics but generally support the Kremlin.\n\nFurgal\u2019s party, the ultranationalist Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR) led by Vladimir Zhirinovsky, is part of the game. But Furgal did not exactly play by the rules.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe defeated the Kremlin-backed candidate for governor in 2018 with nearly 70 percent of the vote and has since added to that popularity. Many Khabarovsk residents believe Furgal is being punished by Moscow for being more popular than Putin. The office of the Kremlin\u2019s Far East official, Trutnev, did not respond to requests for comment on the case.\n\nThe Kremlin has not been subtle about its displeasure. In December, Putin even moved the Far East capital from Khabarovsk to Vladivostok in a slap to the city.\n\nThe protesters \u2014 LDPR nationalists, supporters of liberal opposition leader Alexei Navalny and ordinary disgruntled citizens \u2014 wave Russian flags, chant anti-Putin slogans and demand a transparent murder trial for Furgal in Khabarovsk, not Moscow.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHow does it look from the Kremlin?\u201d Navalny said in a recent video on his YouTube channel. He answered his own question: \u201cA bad example to everyone else.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nPutin named a reliably pro-Kremlin LDPR politician as acting governor, Mikhail Degtyarev, a move that further infuriated locals and reinvigorated the protests.\n\nDegtyarev told one astounded Russian interviewer that there was no difference of opinion between Putin, national party leader Zhirinovsky and the citizens of Khabarovsk on any subject. He claimed the protests were being stirred up by foreigners and people from other parts of Russia.\n\nUnderlying the protests are declining real wages, stagnant living standards and poor services, while government officials, pro-Putin politicians and oligarchs close to the Kremlin get rich exploiting the system.\n\nThe Furgalmobile\n\nThe protests generated a sense of excitement in the city and created local heroes.\n\nAD\n\nOne of them was Rostislav Buryak, who drove around in a minivan known as the Furgalmobile, modeled as a space ship decorated with images of Furgal, blasting out stirring songs and revving up protesters. Buryak was arrested July 28 and jailed for eight days for obstructing traffic.\n\nAD\n\nNational television stations have played down the protests. Alexandra Teplyakova, a journalist who recently resigned from popular independent local television station Guberniya, said local reporters were also under pressure. Her former colleagues at Guberniya TV told her that after the first protest on July 11, their boss warned them they could not air footage of the march or everyone would lose their jobs. She is now participating in the protests and blogging about them on Instagram.\n\n\u201cThe main thing that makes people very angry is that nobody is paying attention to them. And now the slogans are against Putin. People are not afraid anymore,\u201d Teplyakova said. \u201cHe\u2019s not popular, and people believe it\u2019s time for him to resign because he\u2019s been in power too long. That\u2019s enough.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nShe said local people felt they were being punished for \u201celecting the wrong person.\u201d The party leader, Zhirinovsky, wrote on his Telegram channel July 13 that Furgal was arrested because he was too popular.\n\nAD\n\nThe murder case against Furgal is based on the allegations of a business associate, Nikolai Mistryukov, who was arrested in October and has since been diagnosed with cancer in prison. The charges relate to the murders of four business figures in 2004 and 2005, when Furgal was trading in metals, timber and consumer goods. He could face life in prison if convicted.\n\n'Like a match'\n\nPolitical analyst Ildus Yarulin of Pacific Ocean State University in Khabarovsk said part of the discontent stems from small and medium-size businesses being hit hard during the pandemic, with many closing.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhen the governor was detained, it was like a match that ignited the fire,\u201d he said.\n\nDmitry Nizovtsev, a member of Navalny\u2019s team in Khabarovsk, said protesters were initially angered by the removal of Furgal but then turned on Putin.\n\n\u201cThere is very little democracy in Russia to begin with. And two years ago, the people of Khabarovsk got just a tiny piece of democracy. They were able to elect their governor,\u201d said Nizovtsev, who was beaten up recently by several thugs near his home after he returned from a rally in an attack he says was political.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThey liked this little bit of freedom,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Kremlin\u2019s answer to growing discontent has been to crack down on activists, bloggers and independent journalists and tighten control. Prominent journalist Ivan Safronov was charged with treason last month in Moscow. Another journalist, Svetlana Prokopyeva, was convicted of justifying terrorism last month in Pskov, a city in western Russia.\n\nAD\n\nBut Andrei Kolesnikov of the Carnegie Moscow Center wrote that Putin was running out of means to regain popularity. The Khabarovsk protests revealed Russian authorities\u2019 inability to deal effectively with crises such as the economic consequences of the pandemic, he wrote, while ordinary people felt unhappy about the authorities taking away their choices \u2014 in this case their choice of governor."}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/taiwan-and-us-to-hold-highest-level-contact-since-1979-as-china-tensions-grow/2020/08/04/63d84cb4-d6be-11ea-a788-2ce86ce81129_story.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=wp_world", "published": "2020-08-05T11:39:00", "title": "Taiwan and U.S. to hold highest-level meeting since 1979 as China tensions soar", "text": "The highly publicized trip, which Beijing warned would affect regional stability, marks a break from the usual practice in Washington and Taipei.

In the ensuing decades, both parties claimed rightful rule over China and have at times agreed on the principle of the existence of \"one China,\" even as Taiwan transformed itself into a de facto independent democracy without formally declaring independence.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nToday, China's Communist Party maintains the \"reunification\" of China \u2014 by military force, if necessary \u2014 as one of its highest and most sensitive overarching priorities. The leadership objects vehemently to diplomatic gestures, including visits by foreign dignitaries, that appear to give credence to Taiwan's status as a sovereign state. Since Tsai entered office in 2016 on a platform that does not explicitly acknowledge the \"one China\" principle, Beijing has sought to punish her political party by peeling away Taiwan's diplomatic partners, who now number just 15, and boycotting any multinational corporation that recognizes Taiwan as a separate entity.\n\nOn Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin urged the United States to abide by the \"one China\" principle to avoid \"affecting peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.\"\n\n\"China is firmly opposed to official interactions with Taiwan. China has lodged representations with the U.S.,\" he said at a regular briefing. \"Taiwan is the most important and sensitive issue in China-U.S. relations.\"\n\nOf the half-dozen visits by Cabinet-level U.S. officials since the 1990s, the last came in 2014, when Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Gina McCarthy visited.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOfficial exchanges are often delicate affairs; no sitting Taiwanese leader has ever visited Washington, while the State Department rarely publicizes U.S. official visits to Taiwan before they are completed.\n\nTrump broke diplomatic norms days after his election victory in 2016 when he took a congratulatory call from Tsai \u2014 the first time a U.S. leader had spoken directly to his Taiwanese counterpart since Washington switched diplomatic recognition to Beijing.\n\nSince then, the Trump administration has reinforced ties with Taiwan, including with significant weapons sales, and signed into law the Taiwan Travel Act in 2018 that allowed the Taiwanese president to make more extensive layovers in U.S. cities and loosen restrictions on U.S. officials visiting Taiwan.\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile, Trump has pursued a confrontational strategy against Beijing that has accelerated sharply in recent months.\n\nAD\n\nChina has responded by issuing hands-off warnings to the U.S. military, dispatching naval vessels through the Taiwan Strait and conducting large-scale military drills that simulate the island's capture. The tensions have sparked warnings from officials that the risk of a military clash over Taiwan is rising precariously.\n\nWhile a visit by Azar will not be considered as provocative in Beijing as a trip by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, for instance, it revolves around a charged, high-profile issue \u2014 the coronavirus pandemic \u2014 for which the Trump administration has heaped blame on China.\n\nAD\n\nTaiwan has reported fewer than 500 confirmed cases since the start of the pandemic, while China has reported roughly 84,000 cases and the United States nearly 5 million, the most in the world.\n\nTaiwan's Foreign Ministry said Wednesday that it looked forward to \"strengthening Taiwan-U.S. cooperation in areas of medical research, supply chain security, and global health.\"\n\nAD\n\nNatasha Kassam, a researcher at the Lowy Institute in Sydney and a former Australian diplomat who served in Taipei and Beijing, said Azar's visit made sense on face value given Taiwan's outsize success in controlling the disease.\n\n\"But the White House has not been particularly willing to listen to health experts at home,\" she noted.\n\nAD"}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/as-a-grand-hindu-temple-starts-to-rise-prime-minister-modi-is-transforming-india/2020/08/05/5d8859fa-d6a8-11ea-a788-2ce86ce81129_story.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=wp_world", "published": "2020-08-05T14:16:00", "title": "In Modi\u2019s quest to transform India, a grand Hindu temple rises", "text": "For nearly 500 years, a mosque stood at the same spot in the city of Ayodhya.

Fewer than 200 people were invited to the event, and all of them, including Modi, wore face masks.\n\nIndia is grappling with one of the worst outbreaks in the world. More than 50,000 new infections and roughly 800 deaths are being reported daily. The World Health Organization said Wednesday that India topped the global charts for new cases and deaths in the previous 24 hours.\n\nAD\n\nWith infections rising and the economy struggling, the temple groundbreaking is a welcome diversion for Modi, India\u2019s most powerful prime minister in almost five decades.\n\nWednesday\u2019s ceremony underlined how quickly \u2014 and dramatically \u2014 Modi has moved to put his stamp on this nation of more than 1.3 billion people since winning a landslide reelection victory in May 2019.\n\nAD\n\nExactly a year ago, he revoked the semiautonomy granted to Kashmir, India\u2019s only Muslim-majority region, breaking with seven decades of Indian policy. In December, his government passed a law that excluded Muslim migrants from a fast track to citizenship. In February, Hindu-Muslim riots erupted in Delhi, the deadliest such violence in the capital since Indian independence.\n\nAD\n\nIndia\u2019s Muslim community has viewed these developments with alarm. Although roughly 200 million Muslims live in India, they represent only 14 percent of the population. They face discrimination in employment and housing, and fare poorly on measures of socioeconomic progress. Now many fear that they are turning into second-class citizens.\n\nThe construction of the temple in Ayodhya is a prime example. For three decades, the campaign to build the temple devoted to Lord Ram, a beloved deity, has been the animating principle of India\u2019s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. The issue fused religion and politics in an amalgam that proved both effective and combustible.\n\nAD\n\nMany Hindus revere the site as the spot where Lord Ram was born. For some, Wednesday\u2019s ceremony fulfills a yearning to honor a god worshiped for his heroism and virtue.\n\nAD\n\nBut the push to build the temple is not a simple act of religious devotion. Hindu nationalists view much of recent Indian history as a series of humiliations \u2014 centuries of rule by Muslim kings and the British Empire \u2014 that must be rectified.\n\nThey believe a Hindu temple originally stood at the site in Ayodhya and was later torn down by India\u2019s Muslim rulers. The subsequent destruction of the mosque and the ultimate construction of the temple are viewed as the remedy to years of subjugation.\n\nThe Ram temple is a \u201csymbol of nationalism,\u201d said Dattatreya Hosabale, a senior Hindu nationalist ideologue, at an event in Delhi in July. \u201cIt was meant for regaining the self, which was damaged by foreign aggressors.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHindu nationalism is a majoritarian ideology that seeks to create a state \u201cwhere minorities have to give up their separate identity and pay allegiance to the dominant culture,\u201d said Christophe Jaffrelot, a political scientist at the Paris Institute of Political Studies, known as Sciences Po. The construction of the Ram temple is \u201cone more blow\u201d to India\u2019s secular foundations, but there will be others, said Jaffrelot, who studies the Hindu nationalist movement.\n\nThe temple will be built of red sandstone and rise to 161 feet at its highest point. Construction is expected to be completed in 2023, the year before India\u2019s next national elections. In the meantime, there are plans to transform Ayodhya \u2014 a small city on the Ganges river \u2014 with a new railway station, a new airport and a towering statue of Lord Ram. Ahead of Wednesday\u2019s ceremony, the streets leading to the temple got a fresh coat of bright yellow paint and were festooned with saffron-colored flags.\n\n\u201cHistory is being made here,\u201d said Mahant Paramhans Das, a senior Hindu priest in Ayodhya who once threatened to set himself on fire if the temple was not built. \u201cIt is a great moment for all of us because now Lord Ram will have his permanent home.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe temple is being built at the site of the former Babri mosque, which was completed in the 16th century. The legal tussle over whether Hindus or Muslims should control the site began 70 years ago. But it did not emerge as a national flash point until the late 1980s when the Bharatiya Janata Party, or BJP, made the construction of the temple its signature issue and organized processions to Ayodhya, where party leaders rallied supporters to their cause.\n\nAfter one such rally in 1992, a mob using axes, hammers and their bare hands razed the mosque. The demolition sparked riots across the country that are estimated to have killed 2,000 people. The temple project was also at the root of deadly riots in Gujarat in 2002 that left more than 1,000 people dead, mostly Muslims.\n\n\u201cThe divide between Hindus and Muslims grew with the Ram temple movement,\u201d said Anand Patwardhan, a filmmaker who made a documentary on the dispute in 1992. \u201cToday, with a subservient legal system, the BJP has hijacked both secularism and democracy.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA.G. Noorani, a lawyer and constitutional expert who wrote a book on the Ram temple dispute, said Wednesday\u2019s groundbreaking left him dejected. \u201cI feel saddened and depressed,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is no longer the same India.

After 75 years, it continues to cast a shadow over world affairs.\n\nThe bombing of Nagasaki three days later was the second and final time the atomic bomb saw use in war. On Aug. 15, Japan announced its surrender.\n\nThe weapons caused unparalleled destruction, snuffing out more than 150,000 lives. But those were not the last people to die as a result of nuclear detonations.\n\nIn the decades since 1945, the United States, the Soviet Union and at least six other countries set off a total of more than 2,000 nuclear test explosions, which caused tens of thousands of deaths around the world, according to some estimates, along with displacement and environmental degradation that long remained secret and continue to affect communities today.\n\n75 years of nuclear detonations\n\n10,000 kilotons United States U.S.S.R.

Both governments subjected people at home and abroad to high radiation levels, sometimes with indifference. \u201cScientists in the 1950s were certainly aware of risks\u201d posed by tests, said Jacob Hamblin, an Oregon State University researcher. \u201cMilitary demands \u2014 not necessarily in wartime \u2014 provided a justification for exposing large numbers of people, often under a veil of secrecy.\u201d\n\nNo country has conducted more nuclear tests than the United States, which set off its first atomic bomb, in a test code-named Trinity, in New Mexico several weeks before Hiroshima. The barrage of tests that followed wrought a trail of destruction that stretched across continents and decades.\n\nAn aerial view after the first atomic explosion, at Trinity test site in New Mexico on July 16, 1945. (AP) (/AP)\n\nNo one has calculated an accurate global body count linked to nuclear testing, or a figure for major U.S. test sites. The United States conducted tests in Nevada, which saw nearly 1,000 nuclear tests, and the Marshall Islands (located between Hawaii and the Philippines), which saw 67. The effects of the testing have often manifested as an increase in cancer rates. Estimates of the number of people who have died as a result of atmospheric tests conducted by the United States from the 1940s through the 1960s range from more than 10,000 to an order of magnitude beyond that.\n\nWhen tests began in the Marshall Islands in July 1946, U.S. officials relocated inhabitants, promising them they could soon return.\n\nFor many of them, that was never possible.\n\nSome islanders were exposed to high levels of radiation. In the March 1954 Castle Bravo experiment, when U.S. engineers vastly underestimated the impact of a thermonuclear explosion 1,000 times stronger than the Hiroshima bombing, radioactive material rained down on nearby coral reefs, islands and their inhabitants.\n\nThe Marshall Islands were exposed to the daily equivalent of 1.6 Hiroshima-sized explosions between 1946 and 1958, if the impact were spread evenly. Last year, a Columbia University study found that radiation levels in some areas there are still \u201cfar higher than in areas affected by the Chernobyl and Fukushima nuclear disasters.\u201d\n\nObservers on the bridge of the USS Mt.

(Clarence Hamm/AP) (Clarence Hamm/AP)\n\nHilda Heine, who was president of the Marshall Islands until January, told The Washington Post, \u201ca lot of the critical information was not disclosed\u201d at the time of the tests. In the following decades, she said her people faced \u201cbroken promises\u201d and insufficient compensation from the United States.\n\nThe United States has refused to pay $2.3 billion in damages awarded to the Marshall Islanders by a nuclear claims tribunal. And victims in the continental United States have faced similar legal hurdles: The U.S. Radiation Exposure Compensation Act does not cover those all affected and is set to expire in two years unless it is extended.\n\nSoldiers assigned to witness atmospheric tests in Nevada through 1962 were also among those exposed to radiation. A report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Cancer Institute found that testing may have led to thousands of deaths: The report said at least 11,000 U.S. cancer deaths may be attributable to the atmospheric tests between 1951 and 1962.\n\nAccording to research by Keith Andrew Meyers, an economic historian, the atmospheric tests may have affected a wider area than originally assumed, casting radioactive particles across a swath of the United States and affecting mortality patterns on a grand scale, leading to at least 145,000 deaths between 1952 and 1988.\n\nNuclear testing \u201chas always been disproportionately felt by already marginalized communities,\u201d said Matt Korda, a researcher with the Federation of American Scientists\u2019 Nuclear Information Project. \u201cThe U.S. government and the scientific community essentially lied to residents who were living around those sites in Nevada as well as Marshall Islanders about the dangers of radiation exposure.\u201d\n\nThe first Soviet test of a thermonuclear weapon, at the Semipalatinsk test site, on Aug. 12, 1953. (Hulton Archive/Heritage Images/Getty Images) (Heritage Images/Heritage Images/Getty Images)\n\nVictims of the nuclear age\n\nThe Soviet Union chose Semipalatinsk in Kazakhstan as its primary testing site.\n\nHealth authorities in Kazakhstan believe that atmospheric tests exposed up to 1.5 million residents to radiation. The impact may not yet be understood in full. Research cited by the journal Nature suggests adverse cardiovascular affects may be passed down to future generations.\n\nOther countries caused similar problems. Activists in Algeria and French Polynesia continue to blame Paris for radioactive waste left behind after tests, along with lingering health consequences. Britain conducted its initial nuclear tests in Australia, where a Royal Commission later found that they put residents at risk and were prepared with negligence. Britain later moved its tests to Malden Island and Kiritimati (a.k.a. Christmas Island) in the Pacific, where U.K. and U.S. explosions caused ecological damage and threatened the health of locals.\n\nThe French military base on Mururoa Atoll, 750 miles southeast of Tahiti, in French Polynesia, in 1995.

(Francois Mori/AP) (FRANCOIS MORI/ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nIn 1963, the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty \u2014 signed by the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, the United States and later more than 100 other countries \u2014 prohibited all but underground detonations, but France and China conducted atmospheric tests for more than another decade. China conducted a number of tests in Xinjiang, home of the country\u2019s suppressed Uighur Muslim minority.\n\nIn the United States, underground tests came to an end in the early 1990s, after the fall of the Berlin Wall marked the end of the Cold War, and other nations soon followed suit.\n\nIn 1996, President Bill Clinton signed the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, which has since been signed by 183 other countries. Even though the U.S. Senate later refused to ratify the treaty, no known nuclear weapons tests have since been conducted by the United States.\n\nChart key Number of nuclear tests that year Estimated nuclear stockpile United States 1,032 total tests The United States heavily reduced its nuclear stockpile in the early 1990s. 96 nuclear tests in 1962. 31,255 warheads 1945 1992 The U.S.S.R.\u2019s stockpile peaked in 1986 at 40,159 warheads.

The 1954 Castle Bravo test in the Marshall Islands, which contaminated a nearby Japanese fishing boat, led to the creation of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs (Japan Gensuikyo). The organization dispatched experts to communities affected by tests around the world to help build relief campaigns.\n\nThe victims with whom Japan Gensuikyo has been in touch range from \u201cFiji islanders who were mobilized to work in the British nuclear testing in the Pacific,\u201d to American soldiers \u201cwho took part in nuclear tests in the Pacific or Nevada\u201d and \u201cindigenous people irradiated at uranium mining,\u201d Hiroshi Taka, a director of the organization, said in an email.\n\nMeanwhile, fears of a resurgent nuclear arms era are on the rise.\n\nNorth Korea has conducted a handful of nuclear tests. The most recent one, in 2017, was powerful enough to reshape the mountain above it.\n\nIn May, the Trump administration discussed whether to break the United States\u2019 decades-long moratorium and conduct the first U.S. nuclear test explosion since 1992 \u2014 and the first known test this century by a nation other than North Korea, The Washington Post reported. The goal, according to a senior administration official who spoke to The Post, would be to put pressure on China to agree to a follow-on agreement to the Obama-era New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) with Russia.\n\nThe United States \u201ccontinues to observe the 1992 nuclear test moratorium,\u201d said Greg Wolf, a spokesman for the U.S. National Nuclear Security Administration. \u201cNNSA maintains the readiness to conduct an underground nuclear test within 24 to 36 months, if required to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the nation\u2019s stockpile.\u201d\n\nNonproliferation experts warn that a return to testing would inflame international tensions.\n\n\u201cConducting a test and breaking a moratorium that they\u2019ve had for so many years just sends a signal to other countries that it\u2019s okay to do the same,\u201d said Korda, the nonproliferation researcher. As the world commemorates Hiroshima and Nagasaki, he said, the announcement of a U.S. test would be \u201ca giant middle finger to the survivors.\u201d\n\nSources: Johnston\u2019s Archive, State Department, Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.

The Lebanese Red Cross said that dead bodies must be taken to Beirut's morgues directly, because the hospitals could no longer cope. Marwan Abboud, the city's governor, said that as many as a quarter of a million people have been left homeless and that the destruction could take up to $5 billion to repair.\n\nAs the sun rose, the damage was devastating. The scene at the port was almost apocalyptic, with smoke hanging above a crater gouged from the land running down to the sea, and only one side of the warehouse still standing. A silo that provided most of Lebanon's wheat supply was ripped open.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRed Cross workers were still scouring the wrecked and deserted streets in neighborhoods adjoining the port early Wednesday, calling out for residents who might be trapped and injured. At least 4,000 people were wounded, the organization said.\n\nThere are bodies in the rubble and in the waters of the port. Families put out frantic calls for missing loved ones across social media. In the once-vibrant Gemmayze district, Simon Abegi, who works at the popular Cyrano bar, said that he was searching for a young colleague, Rawan Mysto. When he regained consciousness after the explosion, he had seen her covered in blood and lying amid the glass.\n\n\u201cSome guys came by and picked her up. We\u2019ve been to all the hospitals and there\u2019s no sign,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if she\u2019s alive.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn residential neighborhoods near the port, so had been shattered. The atmosphere was one of shell-shock. Historical arched facades were now piles of rubble and rebar. Dazed residents were climbing across rubble. Young volunteers who had arrived from outside Beirut to aid the cleanup appeared stunned at the devastation. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to say,\u201d said one woman, as she swept glass carpeting the street.\n\nQuestions and anger will follow. There were many indications that the blasts may have been a tragic accident. Lebanese Interior Minister Mohammed Fahmi said it appeared that stocks of ammonium nitrate, a fertilizer that can be used in bombmaking, had ignited.\n\nAD\n\nPrime Minister Hassan Diab linked the explosions to 2,700 tons of the dangerous chemical that had been stored at the port since 2014, despite warnings from port officials that the material was not safe.\n\nAD\n\nIn the central Martyrs Square, protesters gathered shortly after midday, some of them in tears. On social media, there were calls for larger demonstrations Wednesday evening.\n\n\n\nOn a nearby road linking east and west Beirut, a man walked past the backed-up cars holding a sign demanding the execution of the country's head of customs, Badri Daher.\n\n\"I promise you that this catastrophe will not pass without accountability \u2026 Those responsible will pay the price,\" Diab said in a televised speech the night before. \"Facts about this dangerous warehouse that has been there since 2014 will be announced, and I will not preempt the investigations.\"\n\nLebanon was already in the throes of economic collapse, accelerated by nationwide protests against a government widely viewed as corrupt and incompetent. Bailout talks with the International Monetary Fund have repeatedly broken down, and senior Lebanese officials have resigned, claiming that negotiators are not serious about meeting the conditions for a deal, even as hundreds of thousands of Lebanese are pushed deeper into poverty.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn the Rosary Sisters' Hospital, patients had been evacuated in the darkness after the blasts shook its walls. Remnants of the scramble were strewn across the sidewalk. Gurneys had been abandoned. A bloody pillow lay on the street. \"What more can we take,\" asked Allam, the finance manager who had watched the explosions from his home the night before.\n\n\"We have a financial crisis. We have a political crisis. We have a health-care crisis, and now this.\"\n\nOne member of the hospital staff had been killed, and 10 others were injured.\n\n\"Do you think the politicians can handle this crisis? This crisis is bigger than the politicians,\" Allam said.\n\nAs the tiny nation reeled, Diab appealed for global help to staunch the suffering. French President Emmanuel Macron was scheduled to arrive in Beiruton Thursday. The European Union said that it was activating its civil protection system to round up emergency workers and equipment from across the 27-nation bloc. A video shared on social media showed French firefighters already at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, preparing to assist.\n\nThe explosions coincide with mounting tensions between Israel and the Lebanese Shiite militia Hezbollah, which maintains a facility at the port and has long been accused by U.S. officials of using it to smuggle weapons into the country.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAn Israeli official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief reporters, said Israel had no role in the Beirut explosions. Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz and Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi offered the Lebanese government medical and humanitarian aid as well as immediate emergency assistance, via international intermediaries because Israel and Lebanon are in a state of war and have no official contact.\n\nIn a statement offering condolences to families of the dead and injured, Hezbollah did not apportion blame. It called the incident a \u201chuge national tragedy\u201d and urged Lebanese to unite to overcome the ordeal.\n\nAt a news conference, President Trump called the explosion a \u201cterrible attack\u201d and said U.S. generals seemed to feel that it was the result of a \u201cbomb of some kind.\u201d But military officials said they had yet to make a solid assessment of the explosions.\n\nCrisis-stricken Lebanon, with its currency crashing and rising numbers of coronavirus infections, is poorly positioned to cope with another disaster, especially on this scale. At least two hospitals were badly damaged in the explosions, and TV footage showed staff evacuating patients to alternate hospitals that were themselves swamped \u2014 in the dark, because the city had no electricity.\n\nThe Red Cross told all ambulances across the country to head to Beirut to report for duty.\n\nThe damage was spread across a wide arc. Windows were blown out and check-in counters were damaged at Beirut\u2019s airport, several miles from the explosion. Doors were blown open and windows rattled at the U.S. Embassy, more than six miles away.\n\nHealth officials warned that the explosion left a toxic cloud of nitrous oxide hanging over the city and told residents to wear masks and stay indoors. The U.S. Embassy issued a similar warning in a message to U.S. citizens. \u201cThere are reports of toxic gases released in the explosion so all in the area should stay indoors and wear masks if available,\u201d the message said."}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/08/04/beirut-explosion-ammonium-nitrate/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=wp_world", "published": "2020-08-05T12:07:34", "title": "What the videos of the Beirut blast tell us about the explosion", "text": "Many not accustomed to seeing large explosions may conflate mushroom clouds and spherical blast waves as nuclear, said Jeffrey Lewis, an arms-control expert and professor at Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey. \u201cBut some of the things we associate with nuclear explosions are just associated with explosions.\u201d\n\nA few things can be concluded from the videos, including some filmed before the bigger of the blasts, which Lewis said may have begun when munitions in storage caught fire.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA rising cloud of white smoke featured crackling and bright pops consistent with when small munitions \u2014 rockets, for instance \u2014 begin cooking off, he said.\n\nThen a fireball erupts, followed by an orb of white that quickly expands from the blast zone.

One, the Hotel Dieu, said it had received over 500 injured people in the first hours after the blasts. For more than an hour after the explosions, people with blood streaming down their faces or limbs wandered the streets trying to find a way of reaching hospitals on roads too clogged with traffic and debris for ambulances and taxis to move.\n\nIn the early hours of Wednesday, Red Cross workers were still scouring the wrecked and deserted streets in neighborhoods adjoining the port, calling out to residents who might be trapped and injured to identify themselves.\n\nThe explosions coincide with mounting tensions between Israel and the Lebanese Shiite militia Hezbollah, which maintains a facility at the port and has long been accused by U.S. officials of using it to smuggle weapons into the country. The incident follows a spate of mysterious blasts at Shiite militia weapon-storage sites in Iraq last year, which Iraqi and Israeli officials have said Israel was responsible for, and more recently a string of explosions at military sites and sensitive locations in Iran, which regional intelligence officials have said Israel, at least in part, was behind.\n\nAn Israeli official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief reporters, said that Israel had no role in the Beirut explosions. Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz and Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi offered the Lebanese government medical and humanitarian aid as well as immediate emergency assistance, via international intermediaries because Israel and Lebanon are in a state of war and have no official contact.\n\nIn a statement offering condolences to families of the dead and injured, Hezbollah did not apportion blame. It called the incident a \u201chuge national tragedy\u201d and urged Lebanese to unite to overcome the ordeal.\n\nAt a news conference, President Trump called the explosion a \u201cterrible attack\u201d and said U.S. generals seemed to feel that it was the result of a \u201cbomb of some kind.\u201d But military officials said they had yet to make a solid assessment of the explosions.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere were many indications that the blasts may have been a tragic accident. Lebanese Interior Minister Mohammed Fahmi said it appeared that stocks of ammonium nitrate, a fertilizer that can be used in bombmaking, had ignited.\n\nPrime Minister Hassan Diab linked the explosions to 2,700 tons of the dangerous chemical that had been stored at the port since 2014, despite warnings from port officials that the material was not safe.\n\n\u201cI promise you that this catastrophe will not pass without accountability. . . . Those responsible will pay the price,\u201d he said in a televised speech. \u201cFacts about this dangerous warehouse that has been there since 2014 will be announced and I will not preempt the investigations.\u201d\n\nBut suspicions lingered that Israel may have been involved, said a senior Lebanese army officer who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the issue is sensitive. Numerous witnesses reported hearing warplanes overhead at the time, he noted.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere are suspicions,\u201d the official said. \u201cThere will be no conclusion until there has been a full investigation.\u201d\n\nIsraeli planes and drones have been spotted flying with increasing regularity over the city in recent weeks as tensions have risen.\n\nOne thing that was clear is that crisis-stricken Lebanon, in the throes of a major economic collapse and battling rising numbers of coronavirus infections, is in little position to cope with another disaster, especially on this scale. At least two hospitals were badly damaged in the explosions, and TV footage showed staff evacuating patients to alternate hospitals that were themselves swamped \u2014 in the dark, because the city had no electricity.\n\nThe Red Cross told all ambulances across the country to head to Beirut to report for duty.\n\nMany residents lost their homes, especially in the majority-Christian eastern part of the city closest to the blast. In the neighborhood of Gemmayze, once a vibrant nightlife district, buildings collapsed, cars were overturned and the streets were blocked by piles of masonry and twisted metal.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe damage was spread across a wide arc. Windows were blown out and check-in counters were damaged at Beirut\u2019s airport, several miles from the explosion. Doors were blown open and windows rattled at the U.S. Embassy, more than six miles away.\n\nHealth officials warned that the explosion had left a toxic cloud of nitrous oxide hanging over the city, and told residents to wear masks and stay indoors. The U.S. Embassy issued a similar warning in a message to U.S. citizens. \u201cThere are reports of toxic gases released in the explosion so all in the area should stay indoors and wear masks if available,\u201d the message said.\n\nAmong the dead was Nazar Najarian, a senior official in the Kataeb political party. The injured included Kamal Hayek, chairman of the state-owned electricity company, according to the state-run National News Agency.\n\nGermany\u2019s Foreign Ministry tweeted that German Embassy employees were among those injured.

It is unclear whether he could be charged at all, as his actions before his abdication are covered by immunity.\n\nBut after the allegations were made public, his son and successor, King Felipe VI, this year canceled the $225,000 annual grant his father received.

When he became king after Franco\u2019s death in 1975, there were concerns about his ties to the fascist dictator. But he was widely credited for having played a key role in the country\u2019s transition to democracy, notably helping to thwart a coup attempt in 1981 aimed at restoring Francoist rule.\n\nAD\n\nJuan Carlos was described as a charismatic leader close to the people who could be harsh against those who abused their power. In a 2007 meeting of leaders, when Venezuelan President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez interrupted Colombian President Alvaro Uribe, Juan Carlos told him: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you shut up!\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut during the 2008 financial crisis, as Spain was suffering a severe downturn, the king and his family faced questions over their lavish lifestyle and accusations of having abused their own power. Allegations of graft by his daughter, Princess Cristina, and her husband began to shine a more uncomfortable light on the monarch.\n\nJuan Carlos abdicated in 2014, citing health reasons, paving the way for Felipe to become king. At the time, royal watchers suspected that political rather than health concerns were behind the transition. Juan Carlos\u2019s popularity had dropped to record lows, and analysts suspected the royal family needed a new face to regain trust.\n\nAD\n\nFelipe has an approval rating of 70 percent in Spain. But supporters of the royal family worry the controversy surrounding his father could spell new trouble for the king and have serious ramifications for Spanish political unity, already strained by repeated attempts of Catalan separatists to split from the country.\n\nThe Barcelona newspaper La Vanguardia described Juan Carlos\u2019s departure as both \u201cpainful\u201d and \u201ctherapeutic.\u201d"}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/kashmir-india-crackdown-anniversary/2020/08/04/19a35776-d63f-11ea-a788-2ce86ce81129_story.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=wp_world", "published": "2020-08-04T06:14:04", "title": "Voices from Kashmir: Inside India\u2019s year-long crackdown", "text": "The government pledged that the move would bring a \u201cnew dawn\u201d of peace and prosperity by jettisoning decades of what it described as failed policies toward Kashmir and bringing it politically closer to the rest of India.\n\nAD\n\nInstead, it\u2019s been a year of upheaval and repression.\n\nKashmir is no stranger to strife. India and Pakistan both claim the territory and have fought two wars and a smaller conflict over its borders. An armed insurgency against Indian rule has continued for more than three decades.\n\nAD\n\nLast August, the Indian government launched a massive crackdown. It restricted all movement, detained thousands of people \u2014 including Kashmir\u2019s political leaders \u2014 and cut off all communications.\n\nThe steps were necessary, it said, to prevent violent protests and avert possible attacks by militant groups it accuses Pakistan of supporting. Pakistan denies the allegations.\n\nAD\n\nThe Internet ban lasted more than 200 days, the longest such shutdown by a democracy. Even now, high-speed Internet has not been restored in the Kashmir Valley, home to more than 8 million people.\n\nHundreds of Kashmiris have been imprisoned under a draconian public safety law or face legally murky forms of house arrest. Schools in Kashmir have barely functioned since last August. They were ordered shut as part of India\u2019s crackdown and then again during the pandemic.\n\nAD\n\nBusiness losses through June are estimated at more than $5 billion, according to the Kashmir Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Attacks by anti-India militants continue, as does cross-border shelling between India and Pakistan.\n\nAD\n\nThe impact of India\u2019s policies has been \u201cdisastrous,\u201d a group of retired Indian judges and civil servants wrote in a recent report. They alleged \u201csystematic violations of human rights\u201d in the region since Aug. 5, 2019.\n\nThree Kashmiris described their experiences over the past year in interviews with The Washington Post. Their accounts have been condensed and edited for clarity.\n\nThe politician\n\nWaheed ur Rehman Para, 32, a leader of the Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Democratic Party, a pro-India political party, who was detained last year and remains under house arrest:\n\nI was arrested on Aug. 5. From the police station I was sent to a detention center. About 30 other people from mainstream political parties were brought in. We stayed there for almost three months.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThen we were shifted to a hostel for members of the state legislature and kept there for the next three months. I have been under house arrest ever since.\n\nOn the first day back home, lots of people came to meet me. Five cops arrived and told me I am not allowed to leave the house. When I tried to leave, they threatened to take me back to detention. They are outside my home 24 hours a day.\n\nThe intent behind our illegal detention was to not allow us to speak and to create an illusion of peace. It was also to send a message to Kashmiris: \u201cWe can do what we want. If we can detain the mainstream leaders and the three [former] chief ministers, we can detain anyone.\u201d That tells you a lot.\n\nAD\n\nAt the detention center, there were two people to a room. Our families could meet us once a week after asking permission. We were not allowed to step outside on the grass. We used to walk the corridors for hours. That was our space. We had only the freedom of being able to walk in a corridor.\n\nAD\n\nEverything was being heard. Cameras and microphones were very visible. It was all under surveillance. Mobile phones were not working, no one [except family members] was allowed to meet us. We felt helpless.\n\nWhat has Delhi actually achieved with this decision? The whole democratic space has been diminished. Have they achieved development? Have they achieved peace? Have they achieved normalcy? Have they achieved anything, other than polarizing people in the country?\n\nAD\n\nWe feel a sense of suffocation at the personal level and political level. I think that has been the worst part of it. You could not talk, you could not speak. You can see and watch things going on \u2014 things happening to you \u2014 and you are not being consulted anywhere. Leaders are actually scared to talk. It\u2019s too risky.\n\nThe government thinks silence is a victory. But in a democracy, if people are silent, then that is the biggest protest.\n\nThe entrepreneur\n\nAdil Sathu, 35, founder of an online travel portal, TripShope:\n\nAD\n\nI run a business-to-business travel portal. I started it in 2015. We had a thousand travel agents in Kashmir working with us. They would come to our website to book airline tickets and hotel rooms. We provide them with credit and pay a commission. It was the first such portal in Kashmir.\n\nAD\n\nOn Aug. 5, I watched in horror as my years of hard work disappeared. I had built my company bit by bit, against the odds in a place like Kashmir. That day changed it completely.\n\nOur work is entirely based on the Internet, and without it, we became completely dysfunctional.\n\nAfter a month without Internet, we moved our office from Kashmir to Delhi. We moved to Jammu at the end of October. I was so fed up of shifting my staff that I almost called it a day. Just for a basic facility like Internet, me and my staff were traveling thousands of kilometers like refugees. It was really humiliating.\n\nAD\n\nI was totally depressed at that time. I could not see my future. I didn\u2019t know what to do.\n\nAD\n\nWe suffered financial losses of over $65,000. I had to lay off staff. I had taken bank loans to start this travel portal. We are going backward day by day. Now because of covid we are suffering again.\n\nThe irony is that now India-based travel agents don\u2019t find us a reliable partner. They say Kashmir is unpredictable and there can be another communication blackout anytime, which is not good for business. But Indians are the ones who hailed Aug. 5 as a moment of a new dawn for Kashmir. When is the new dawn?\n\nThe daughter\n\nIram Khan, 37, whose father was killed in a shootout between security forces and militants:\n\nAll I know is that over the past year, the situation has turned bad in Kashmir. We all have grown up with memories of violence. When I was in seventh grade, there was a small get-together at a relative\u2019s house. We were expecting some guests, including a woman who was seven months pregnant. There was some tension in the area. Paramilitary forces shot her. She died on the spot.\n\nAD\n\nI never thought that my family would go through a similar tragedy.\n\nI was at home in Srinagar [on July 1] when I received a call from my mother. She told me Papa has died in a car accident. She was sobbing.\n\nI knew my youngest son, Iyaad, had accompanied my father, Bashir Ahmad Khan. I was sure that he must have died along with my father.\n\nWhen I reached my parents\u2019 home, the neighbors told me instead that my father had been shot. Then one showed me a picture of Iyaad, which had gone viral by that time. He was sitting on my father\u2019s dead body, crying.\n\nThe cops told my brother that our father was killed in the crossfire after militants attacked a vehicle of the CRPF [Central Reserve Police Force]. But we were suspicious of the police version of events. Our father\u2019s car did not have a single scratch on it.\n\nAD\n\nThe inspector general of police has assured us they will conduct an inquiry, but nothing has happened so far. I have little hope. There is no possibility of justice in Kashmir.\n\nI have been to the spot where my father was killed and talked to people living nearby. All they said was that they had heard a child crying. Even if they had seen something, they wouldn\u2019t say it. I know they are afraid.\n\nIyaad doesn\u2019t understand what death is. He still asks for Papa. Yesterday, I went out to do some work, and he asked me, \u201cAre you going to bring Papa home?\u201d He asks everyone when Papa will come back.\n\nI won\u2019t blame any side. But people are sad. There is no happiness anywhere in Kashmir. Every household has a painful story."}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/08/04/closing-schools-around-world-could-cause-generational-catastrophe-un-secretary-general-warns/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=wp_world", "published": "2020-08-04T05:12:15", "title": "Closing schools around the world could cause a \u2018generational catastrophe,\u2019 U.N. secretary-general warns", "text": "A policy brief published alongside Guterres\u2019s message emphasized that suppressing transmission of the virus is \u201cthe single most significant step\u201d leaders can take toward reopening schools.\n\nGuterres\u2019 comments come as countries around the world wrestle with how to keep students engaged while limiting the risk of coronavirus transmission and as parents struggle with child-care challenges.\n\nAD\n\nAs of Aug. 2, more than 1 billion students in more than 160 countries were affected by school closures, according to data collected by the U.N.

The city was Hiroshima.\n\nHoward was not supposed to be on the roof, his grandmother shouting as the air raid siren sounded. Then again, neither he nor his brother were supposed to be in Japan at all. Born in California, they were Americans, like their mother and father before them, like unknown numbers of U.S. citizens who were caught in that city on that day and forever after associated with the atomic bomb and the horrors it unleashed.\n\nA dozen servicemen, crew members of aircraft downed in the final days of the war and held as prisoners, died after the bomb detonated. But hundreds, some say thousands, of other Americans also perished or suffered and bore witness. Many were children from Hawaii and the West Coast who had arrived in the prewar years to visit relatives or absorb the culture of their families\u2019 heritage.

For decades, these doctors have met with survivors, collected blood, measured vitals, taken X-rays and interviewed them about what ails them, be it the lingering effects of radiation or the complications of aging.\n\nForty Americans made themselves available to the doctors last November. Among them: Howard Kakita, a retired computer engineer, father and grandfather.\n\n\u201cThere are not too many of us left,\u201d he says softly.\n\nHis story, like that of many American A-bomb survivors, is seldom part of the popular literature surrounding Hiroshima. Yet it is distinctly both a Japanese and American tale, one filled with tragedy, betrayal, heroism and eventual forgiveness.\n\nHoward Kakita's paternal grandfather, Yaozo, stands in the courtyard of his home in Hiroshima in 1940. (Family photo) Howard Kakita and his older brother, Kenny, pose with their mother, Tomiko, and paternal grandmother, Matsuko, in Hiroshima. The boys and their parents had sailed from California in early 1940 for an extended visit with relatives. (Family photo)\n\nHoward\u2019s story begins with his grandfather, Yaozo, a farmer and the first of his family to come to America. He was 22 when he boarded a transport ship in 1899, knowing no English but sure that the ticket he held was a ticket to a land of opportunity.\n\nWhat awaited him was something different \u2014 anti-Japanese hysteria, a law that barred him from naturalization, and years of hardship. He retreated to Hiroshima but was unable to shake the American Dream.\n\nIn 1906 he came again, joined by his young bride. They settled in Bakersfield, Calif., where eight children would be born, each an American citizen, the birthright conferred by the 14th Amendment. Desperate for acceptance, Yaozo registered for the 1918 draft as \u201cCharlie\u201d Kakita.\n\nStill, life in the states was no easier the second time around; the law prohibited Japanese immigrants from owning land or holding long-term leases. In 1927, Yaozo\u2019s wife died in childbirth. He returned to Hiroshima and remarried, only to watch each of his sons choose a future in America over one in Japan. By 1940, he had sunk into a deep depression and turned to drink. He seemed close to dying.\n\nEarly that year, son Frank, the second-oldest, and his wife, Tomiko, sailed to Hiroshima to introduce Yaozo to his two grandsons and stay for the birth of their next child. The months-long visit was the perfect tonic; the patriarch recovered his health. But when Frank announced that the family needed to go home to California, Yaozo\u2019s mood again darkened. So Frank and Tomiko made him and his wife an offer: As a show of good faith that they would return, they would leave 2-year-old Howard and 4-year-old Kenny in their care.\n\nThen Japan attacked Pearl Harbor in 1941, and everything changed. War \u2014 and its cruel aftermath \u2014 would separate them for nearly all of the decade.\n\nThree-quarters of a century after the United States became the first and only country to use an atomic bomb in wartime, Howard Kakita is still bearing witness to what happened. (Philip Cheung for The Washington Post)\n\nOnly as a young man did Howard begin to realize how miraculous his survival was. His grandparents lived less than a mile from Hiroshima\u2019s ground zero. For several moments, he lay unconscious under the rubble then dug himself out. His grandfather rescued his grandmother from the mountain of debris that had been their house.\n\nThey fled with his brother toward the mountains, away from the all-consuming fires, passing bodies with entrails exposed. For years, Howard could not eat foods with flecks of pink or red, be it grapefruit or beef. The sight of spaghetti turned his stomach.\n\n\u201cIt reminded me of blood and gore,\u201d he recalls now.\n\nWhen they came back to their obliterated neighborhood, the air was filled with the stench of mass cremations. They and those around them salvaged whatever metal and wood they could find to put a roof over their heads. Both Howard and Kenny suffered dysentery and lost their hair from the radiation exposure. Their maternal grandmother, they learned, had literally vanished in the blast. Their maternal grandfather would die within days. The couple, sweet-potato farmers, had just been in the city for the weekday market.\n\nHiroshima's downtown shopping district was a center of activity before the city was flattened by a U.S. atomic bomb on Aug. 6, 1945. (National Archives)\n\nThe atomic bomb obliterated virtually all of Hiroshima. Eight months later, the landscape was little changed. (Army Recruiting Service/AP)\n\nOn the other side of the Pacific, their parents assumed both boys perished. Like some 120,000 Japanese Americans, Frank and Tomiko had spent the last three years in an internment camp. Theirs was a desert landscape in Arizona so hostile that guard towers were unnecessary. And that\u2019s where they still were when the American Red Cross finally confirmed that their children were alive.\n\nBut the end of the war brought no reunion. The Kakitas were released from the camp, handed a one-way ticket and $25. But they had no money to pay for Howard and Kenny\u2019s passage from Japan. More months became years. On Aug. 8, 1947, grandfather Yaozo died of cancer \u2014 \u201ca casualty of the bomb,\u201d Howard says.\n\nThe following March, against their will, the boys were placed on a ship to San Francisco \u2014 a foreign land with a foreign language, two parents they did not remember and two little brothers they did not know.\n\nTheir reentry was fraught. The family lived in a three-story tenement. The parents did not speak of their internment; the sons did not speak of the bomb. Howard, now 9, was beset by nightmares and woke up screaming.\n\nYears would pass before \u201cthe fog lifted,\u201d and he could discuss Hiroshima publicly. Kenny remains intensely private about sharing the past. \u201cI can\u2019t talk about it,\u201d he told Howard recently. \u201cI get too emotional.\u201d\n\nIt would take several years after World War II ended for Howard Kakita and his brother, Kenny, to be reunited with their parents and siblings. A 1949 photo in the family's living room in California shows the boys arranged youngest to oldest: Allan, front left, Albert, Howard and Kenny. On the sofa are the boys' aunt, Eiko, left; mother, Tomiko; and father, Frank. (Family photo)\n\nHoward\u2019s evolution from silent survivor to reticent witness to full-throated chronicler of the atomic bomb\u2019s catastrophic toll reflects the narrative arc of any number of American hibakusha, who recognize the time to tell their story is growing short.\n\n\u201cI do feel a responsibility,\u201d he explains from his home in Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif., where, at 82, he is busy preparing a webinar with other survivors to mark the upcoming anniversary. \u201cI am at that twilight zone where I am one of the youngest guys who remember the experience of the Hiroshima bombing, and after me, there is probably no one else. Those younger will not remember.\u201d\n\nLast fall, he spoke to hundreds of history students at his alma mater, the University of California at Los Angeles. He has shared his story at the Japanese American National Museum, and Hiroshima\u2019s Peace Memorial Museum has videotaped him as part of its collection of survivors\u2019 memories.\n\nPart of his bigger narrative is what his life became in this country. While his transition was turbulent at first, the trauma receded and he soon flourished \u2014 as a Boy Scout, math whiz, high school track star and varsity football player. He studied engineering at UCLA and got a master\u2019s degree in computer architecture.\n\nIn 1960, as a graduate student, he met a freshman named Irene Doiwchi. She was a Japanese American born in the Amache, Colo., internment camp. Her father had volunteered for the legendary all-Japanese American 442nd Infantry Regiment, which was awarded more than a dozen Medals of Honor. Suiyo Doiwchi earned four Bronze Stars and helped liberate the Dachau concentration camp in Germany \u2014 his way \u201cof proving his loyalty to the United States,\u201d according to his daughter.\n\nNot until Howard was considering marriage did he bring up Hiroshima with Irene. \u201cI had to tell her that I was exposed to serious radiation, that I may not live that long,\u201d he says.\n\nIrene was undeterred. \u201cCall it blind faith or something,\u201d she says. \u201cI told myself I was meant to be with this man, come hell or high water, no matter what comes along.\u201d\n\nThe La Plata Maru took the Kakitas \u2014 Howard, big brother Kenny, and parents Frank and Tomiko \u2014 to Japan in January 1940. (Family photo) Howard Kakita, right, his older brother, Kenny, and paternal grandfather, Yaozo, all lost their hair because of radiation exposure from the atomic bomb blast in Hiroshima. (Family photo)\n\nFor a time, that past seemed a distant memory. Howard was designing early computers, first for aerospace companies, then Xerox. But the shadow of Hiroshima descended once more when their 4-year-old son Randy was diagnosed with cancer in 1968. He died in less than six months.\n\n\u201cWas it my fault?\u201d Howard wondered, again fearing the legacy of his exposure. (Two daughters and four grandchildren have had no such scares.)\n\nThe Kakitas long ago reconciled themselves to history, just as Japan and the United States attempted to do the same. In 1988, the U.S. government pledged $20,000 in reparations to every Japanese American forced into a camp; about 82,000 survivors ultimately received payments. Japan continues to wire monthly payments to American survivors based on their proximity to the bomb \u2014 Howard gets about 30,000 yen, or $300 \u2014 as well as send the medical teams for those biennial health assessments.\n\n\u201cWe are the living guinea pigs,\u201d he says, with the exams providing doctors and researchers insights into the long-term effects of radiation.\n\nLast September, Howard and Irene visited Hiroshima and its peace museum. It was either his fourth or fifth trip back, and he noted that the exhibitions had become less graphic and less likely to shock visitors. Yet his own sense of purpose has only intensified.\n\n\u201cThere is a Japanese phrase \u2014 \u2018shikata ga nai,\u2019 which means \u2018it cannot be helped,\u2019 \u201d he says, and this fatalism is how many Japanese came to terms with tragedy and misfortune. He now disagrees. \u201cIt is not something that cannot be helped,\u201d he stresses. \u201cWe should learn from it, we should understand.\u201d"}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/trump-views-chinas-communist-party-as-a-threat-young-chinese-see-it-as-a-ticket-to-a-better-future/2020/08/03/6a950c0a-c803-11ea-a825-8722004e4150_story.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=wp_world", "published": "2020-08-04T10:00:00", "title": "Trump views China\u2019s Communist Party as a threat. Young Chinese see it as a ticket to a better future.", "text": "\u201cMy grandmother was so happy when she knew that I was coming to Changsha,\u201d said Xia Yuxin, a 22-year-old university student in Beijing, as she jostled on a recent day for the perfect selfie with the Great Helmsman. \u201cShe told me: \u2018You must go visit Chairman Mao.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAD\n\nNearby, sweaty recruits from the 23rd Metallurgical Construction Group, part of a state-owned construction and mining firm, gathered to recite one of Mao\u2019s poems, \u201cChangsha.\u201d \u201cI ask, on this boundless land / Who rules over man\u2019s destiny?\u201d they shouted in unison.\n\nAD\n\nThe answer, in this instance, is the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nAfter seven decades in power, the ruling party has faced potentially existential challenges over the past year, from pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong and an economic slowdown to a devastating coronavirus and, most recently, once-in-a-generation floods that have wreaked destruction across central China.\n\nBut far from diminishing its stature at home, as some in the Trump administration appear to believe, the party\u2019s response to some of these crises has helped solidify the support of existing and aspiring members \u2014 or at least neutralized grumbling.\n\nChinese who were complaining in February about the party\u2019s coronavirus coverup reflect more positively on their experience now that they can see, through the American example, how much worse it could have been.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s strange to think of the Communist Party as weaker, because all of us feel that our country and our party have grown stronger in the face of this epidemic,\u201d said Xia, who was dressed more like a pop star than a propaganda star. Like her father, she joined the party at age 20.\n\nIn a confrontation that is no longer just economic but ideological, the Trump administration is taking aim at the Communist Party. Leading the charge is Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who used a speech at the Nixon presidential library last month to blast the \u201cChinese Communist Party\u2019s designs for hegemony\u201d and to lay out a strategy \u201cto truly change Communist China.\u201d\n\nWang Wei, a professor at the Hunan provincial branch of the Communist Party School, said Pompeo\u2019s comments revealed the Trump administration\u2019s worry about China eclipsing the United States.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis just shows that they fear a stronger Communist Party and a stronger China after we showed our might in the battle against the coronavirus epidemic,\u201d she said.\n\nConnections boost prospects\n\nIt\u2019s easy for people outside China to view the Communist Party as a throwback to Soviet times, which, in many ways, it is.\n\nIt runs China as a one-party state with no opposition allowed, and heavily censors the Internet, making it difficult to access information that doesn\u2019t fit the official narrative. It holds dreary meetings where men sit on stages surrounded by red flags, droning on in Communist argot about central economic plans and staying true to the mission.\n\nBut in China, the reality is more complicated. The party may remain bound by many of the strictures first envisaged by Mao and his comrades in the 1920s, and these pronouncements may hint at underlying alarm about the challenges China faces, but the organization is relevant to many people\u2019s lives.\n\nParty membership means better education prospects and better jobs, more politically advantageous marriages and nicer apartments. For many, it is a ticket to a brighter future.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIf you want an important job, or even to work in a university or a social organization, if you\u2019re not a party member, you won\u2019t be promoted,\u201d said Zheng Yongnian, a Chinese political scientist who teaches at the National University of Singapore. \u201cPlus, young people these days are quite nationalistic, so they are choosing to join the party.\u201d\n\nSome 80 percent of recruits last year were younger than 35, according to official party statistics.\n\nBecoming a member is an arduous process that people can begin only when they turn 18.\n\nAfter submitting a letter outlining why she or he believes in the party \u2014 and also acknowledging personal shortcomings \u2014 an applicant must go through courses and pass tests, then submit recommendations from two party members.\n\nAD\n\nThose who make it through enter a probationary period that lasts at least a year but can often take much longer, and membership is not guaranteed. But those who make the cut must take an oath, swearing to \u201cbe ready at all times to sacrifice my all for the party and the people, and never betray the party.\u201d\n\nXi Jinping, the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao, has ramped up ideological education since he took control of the party in 2012 and has sought to make its institutions even more formidable. One of his innovations was to insist that members study Xi Jinping Thought, his personal ideology, each day using a smartphone app.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt must be clearly understood that the greatest national feature of China is the leadership of the Communist Party,\u201d Xi said in an article published in a party journal last month.\n\nAs part of its efforts to confront China and Xi\u2019s leadership of it, the Trump administration is reportedly considering banning members of the Communist Party and their families from traveling to the United States.\n\nThe party\u2019s membership stood at almost 92 million at the end of last year, according to the Central Committee\u2019s Organization Department. That could mean some 270 million people \u2014 one-fifth of China\u2019s population \u2014 would face a U.S. entry ban.\n\nAD\n\nWhile the total number of party members has continued to grow, the rate of increase has slowed under Xi, from about 3.2 million in 2012 to only 1.3 million last year.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe party has always been a mass organization masquerading as an elite,\u201d said Richard McGregor, author of \u201cThe Party: The Secret World of China\u2019s Communist Rulers.\u201d \u201cBut one of the most striking things about the CCP under Xi is that it is, in fact, becoming more of an elite. In other words, it is getting harder to be admitted as a member.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Xi is trying to ensure that the membership is more ideologically pure.\n\n\u201cThey are weeding out those simply interested in using membership to advance their careers or business but not actually believing in the party\u2019s guiding ideology or participating meaningfully in party bodies,\u201d said David Gitter, president of the Center for Advanced China Research, a Washington-based think tank.\n\nOpportunity in a crisis\n\nSome aspiring party members \u2014 whether they be police officers or nurses or students \u2014 are using this year\u2019s catastrophes to demonstrate commitment to the cause and expedite their applications. In February, Xi said that applicants who showed outstanding performance \u201cat the front line of the battle\u201d could join the club.\n\nHere in Hunan province, which borders the coronavirus epicenter of Hubei and where rivers burst their banks during extreme flooding last month, would-be members have found opportunities to prove their worth. State media has been full of stories of people who volunteered to go to Wuhan during the coronavirus outbreak or, more recently, worked on flood control.\n\n\u201cAs an active applicant, I want to bear my responsibility to serve society and to learn from those model party members at the front line of flood prevention work,\u201d Zhou Ziyi, an 18-year-old studying at Hunan Industry Polytechnic who has volunteered to patrol the embankments, told local media.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOne of those hoping to be admitted is Lu, a materials science student in Changsha who applied for membership two years ago and is on probation.\n\n\u201cI have no idea when I\u2019ll become a full member, there are too many people waiting in the line,\u201d said Lu, whose father is a party member and who asked to use only his surname while discussing sensitive political issues.\n\nHe wants to join partly because he agrees with the party ideology, but mainly because he wants a future in academia \u2014 and membership will help with that. This is even with the knowledge that party membership would make it more difficult to study in the United States, where Chinese scientists are increasingly viewed as spies.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI think most university students are willing to join the party,\u201d he said, taking a break from his laptop in a cafe here. \u201cThere\u2019s good and bad with it, but generally speaking, the good triumphs. I think many students also believe that by joining, they could help lead the party towards a better future.\u201d"}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/why-tiktok-was-destined-to-land-in-trumps-crosshairs/2020/08/04/e0526798-d56f-11ea-a788-2ce86ce81129_story.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=wp_world", "published": "2020-08-04T09:31:00", "title": "Why TikTok was destined to land in Trump\u2019s crosshairs", "text": "So the battle over viral short-video app TikTok is not about its current reach to American teens, but the potential reach of this catchy communication format from China.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTikTok\u2019s parent company, ByteDance, is in talks to sell its U.S. business to Microsoft, after unsuccessful attempts to allay U.S. regulatory concerns about Beijing\u2019s surveillance and censorship.\n\n\n\n\u201cCFIUS determined that ByteDance must fully divest TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations,\u201d ByteDance chief executive Zhang Yiming wrote to employees in an email Monday, using the acronym for the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. \u201cWe disagree with CFIUS\u2019s conclusion.\u201d\n\n\n\nAD\n\nZhang wrote that ByteDance\u2019s executives \u201cunderstand their decision in the current macro environment.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a measure of how much the U.S.-China business landscape has changed, that Microsoft may now be TikTok\u2019s best prospect. In 2008, Zhang, the future ByteDance founder, got a job at Microsoft but quit months later, finding work there unstimulating.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t anything really bad,\u201d he said about his time at Microsoft, in a video interview with China\u2019s Caishi Media years later. \u201cIt was just boring. I could basically read half the day and work half the day.\u201d\n\n\n\nAt the end of 2018, ByteDance became the world\u2019s most valuable start-up, and it has retained the title since. The company says it has 100 million users in the United States, a reach that has brought the issue of Chinese government censorship to America\u2019s doorstep.\n\n\n\nAD\n\nNo other Chinese social media platform has gained anywhere near such a following in the West. Weibo and Renren never got far beyond localized imitations of Twitter and Facebook, which were banned in China. WeChat, China\u2019s chat app of choice, was a bona fide innovator, years ahead of Facebook in integrating mobile payments, small group chats, stickers and other features into its messaging platform.\n\n\n\nStill, WeChat never felt native outside of China, even putting aside the issue of surveillance by an authoritarian government. Some of its most useful domestic features, like mobile payments and ride-hailing, had limited functionality abroad. WeChat\u2019s walkie-talkie-like function also had limited draw overseas, though it made sense in a country without an alphabet and where 3 percent of the population is illiterate and far more don\u2019t know how to type on a computer.\n\nAD\n\nThe international version of WeChat remained slightly lost in translation for years, with the \u201ctalk-to-the-hand\u201d emoji, used in China to convey disdain, annotated in English as \u201cwave.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTikTok, though, provided a seamless experience overseas from the get-go \u2014 aided by the universality of short funny videos, a medium that transcends language and borders.\n\n\n\nAs with many other Chinese Internet start-ups, ByteDance has had its battles with Chinese censors. ByteDance\u2019s popular news aggregator app Toutiao has been temporarily suspended by authorities at times.\n\nByteDance\u2019s jokes and memes app, Neihan Duanzi, was shut down in 2018 after Beijing regulators criticized it for vulgar content. Zhang issued an apology and pledged to hire thousands more content reviewers for the company\u2019s other apps.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe product has gone astray, posting content that goes against socialist core values,\u201d he wrote of Neihan Duanzi in the lengthy public apology.\n\n\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDan Wang, a technology analyst at Gavekal Dragonomics, said that the U.S. government has not produced a \u201csmoking gun\u201d that ByteDance has harmed U.S. national security, but it was hard for it or any Chinese tech company to prove that it can be independent from Beijing. U.S. officials say that ByteDance has to comply with China\u2019s censorship, which TikTok denies, saying its servers for international users are in the United States and Singapore.\n\n\u201cIn another era, or with another country, these concerns might have been manageable,\u201d he said. \u201cBut U.S.-China relations are at their worst point in decades.\u201d\n\nTikTok is the latest in a line of new communication technologies that began with simpler intentions but were drawn into politics once they reached a critical mass. Mark Zuckerberg started Facebook to connect fellow students. The founders of Twitter \u2014 then, \u201ctwittr\u201d \u2014 wanted a place for their stream-of-consciousness musings.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRadio was used in the early days by sailors, who before then could only communicate with flags. During the Cold War, pro- and anti-Communist groups found it a useful tool for blasting propaganda across borders.\n\nThe last major wave of anti-China sentiment in the United States unfolded in the 1950s with the popularization of television. The entertainment and media industry came under heavy scrutiny in the McCarthy hearings, as the broad reach of TV and film became apparent.\n\nThe scrutiny of TikTok has come early in the process, with the medium still largely used by teenagers to share dancing videos. Companies and political groups are still figuring out how to use the platform.\n\nAD\n\nBut politics has begun trickling into the mix, both in China and the United States. Muslim Uighurs in China\u2019s oppressive Xinjiang region last year began using the app to share information about detained relatives. Teenagers used the app to falsely inflate projected attendance for Trump\u2019s Tulsa rally.\n\nAD\n\nAnd not least, the teenagers on TikTok today may not yet be voting age, but they will be soon.

It follows the announcement Saturday by Afghanistan's main intelligence agency that the militant group's intelligence director had been killed near Jalalabad.\n\nAD\n\nThe attack also comes at a tense moment, as pressure builds to bring the Taliban and Afghan government together for peace talks. It began just hours before a confidence-building cease-fire was set to end, and the complex planning it entailed prompted suspicions among Afghan officials of Taliban involvement despite a statement from the group denying responsibility.\n\nBait and switch\n\nThe assault started when a car bomb targeting the prison's main gate detonated just after 6:30 p.m. Sunday, killing three policemen. But as Afghan security forces rushed to the scene, one group of gunmen took over a high-rise building abutting the complex while a second group launched another attack from the back of the prison, using rocket-propelled grenades to blast through a perimeter wall bordering a residential neighborhood.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"The car bomb was just a distraction,\" said a local Afghan security official who was at the scene. \"There is no way they could have entered through the main gate. It's too fortified. The back of the prison, that was the weak point.\"\n\n\n\nThe official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media, said it is thought the attack was carried out by 20 to 30 men. He said the relatively small group was able to take over the sprawling complex because the men coordinated with prisoners inside. \"They knew exactly where they were going,\" he said. The gunmen overpowered the prison guards, began dividing up prisoners and raided the complex's weapons stores, handing weapons out to some of the prisoners.\n\nA second Afghan official, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity, confirmed that account.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHekmatullah, a prisoner wounded in the attack, said that after the initial explosion, prison guards locked the inner gates, but that just an hour later, gunmen in camouflage uniforms managed to enter.\n\nThe assailants started yelling at the prisoners, \"Leave or we will shoot you,\" said Hekmatullah, who like many Afghans goes by one name. Once the assailants began firing, prisoners ran in all directions, and that's when he was shot, he said. He was taken to a hospital for treatment.\n\nOnce inside the prison, the gunmen raised an Islamic State flag over one of the towers, Hekmatullah said.\n\nThe prison held more than 1,700 inmates at the time of the attack, including fighters with links to the Islamic State and the Taliban, as well as criminals, according to the first official. As of Monday evening, more than 330 inmates remained at large, he said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe assault quickly turned into a standoff because the heavily armed militants perched atop the nearby high-rise had a direct line of sight to the complex\u2019s main entrance and courtyard. Afghan forces were able to enter the prison only after they cleared the packed high-rise, which houses shops, offices and apartments.\n\nEven then, they had to move slowly because intelligence reports warned that the attackers planned to detonate explosives once government forces entered the prison.\n\nAfter the blasts that rocked the complex during the clearing operation, the bodies of six suicide bombers were recovered.\n\n\u201cThe attackers knew their plan. It was very sophisticated,\u201d the first official said.\n\nDisputed claims\n\nAfghan officials have repeatedly alleged links between the Taliban and the Islamic State, claiming that the groups aid each other in staging attacks and share training pipelines. After the Jalalabad assault, Afghanistan\u2019s interior minister echoed those allegations in a tweet, saying that when the Haqqani network and Taliban fighters carry out attacks that do \u201cnot suit them politically they rebrand it under\u201d the Islamic State.\n\nWhile evidence of direct links is flimsy, the long-held theory highlights the depths of distrust between the Afghan government and the Taliban movement and threatens progress toward formal peace talks.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Jalalabad prison operation was almost identical to past Taliban attacks. A Taliban raid on a prison in Ghazni in 2015 that freed more than 350 prisoners also began with a car bomb that breached the complex\u2019s perimeter before gunmen stormed the buildings.\n\nFor months, Afghan officials have feared that Taliban fighters displeased with the group\u2019s participation in peace talks would join the Islamic State, potentially bringing battlefield expertise and tactics with them.\n\nConcerns about Taliban involvement in the attack touch on questions regarding the Taliban\u2019s intention to uphold counterterrorism assurances and the ability of the Taliban political leadership in Qatar to control the group\u2019s fighters on the ground. Both issues are becoming increasingly important in the lead-up to peace talks.\n\nAfghan President Ashraf Ghani did not accuse any single group of carrying out the attack, but in a Facebook post Monday, he called it a \u201cbarbaric act . . . a crime against humanity and contrary to the Islamic values.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nUntil the Sunday night attack, the cease-fire marking the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha had largely held. The truce was intended as a confidence-building measure to aid in the push for direct peace talks. After the signing of the U.S.-Taliban peace deal, intra-Afghan negotiations have been delayed for months by an escalation of violence and a controversial prisoner swap.\n\nThe Islamic State was not a party to the cease-fire, and Sunday\u2019s attack would probably not constitute a violation of the truce. But it highlights the kind of violence that could continue in Afghanistan even in the event of a peace deal with the Taliban.\n\nAfghanistan\u2019s Islamic State offshoot has asserted responsibility for several recent attacks in Kabul in which gunmen stormed buildings and held off security forces for hours. But the group has largely focused on civilian targets in areas that are home to religious and ethnic minorities, rather than highly fortified government buildings.\n\nThe Taliban and Afghan government officials are still wrangling over a controversial prisoner swap that has emerged as a key stumbling block to peace talks.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe U.S.-Taliban peace deal called for the release of prisoners on both sides before the launch of intra-Afghan peace talks. Now, months overdue, the Afghan government announced it would release 5,000 prisoners as the Taliban demanded before talks could begin. But the sides remain at odds over who should be included in the 5,000. Taliban officials seek the release of hundreds of fighters linked to deadly high-profile attacks, a move opposed by government officials and international human rights organizations."}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/08/03/its-not-just-united-states-these-governments-see-tiktok-growing-problem/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=wp_world", "published": "2020-08-03T06:19:33", "title": "It\u2019s not just the United States: These governments see TikTok as a growing problem.", "text": "In recent months, as tensions between Washington and Beijing mounted amid the novel coronavirus pandemic, analysts and officials have become increasingly concerned that the app, which is owned by the Beijing-based Internet technology company ByteDance, could give the Chinese government access to a wide range of user data.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis particular situation very much revolves around the China element and the origins of the app,\u201d Britain-based social media industry commentator Matt Navarra said Monday.\n\nAD\n\nMicrosoft is in talks to buy the app\u2019s U.S. operations. ByteDance may have no choice but to sell or move out of the country.\n\nBut the United States is not alone. Here are some places that have raised alarm over TikTok.\n\nIndia\n\nBefore India banned TikTok earlier this summer, it was available in 14 languages and had an estimated 200 million users in the country \u2014 its largest market outside of China.\n\nThe move came after 20 Indian soldiers were killed in a border clash with Chinese troops in the Himalayas on June 16. Tensions spiked between the two countries, and India imposed bans on more than 50 Chinese apps, including TikTok, fashion and shopping app Shein and messaging app WeChat.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cTik Tok continues to comply with all data and security requirements under Indian law,\u201d the platform said in a statement released June 29, adding that it had not shared any information with any foreign government. The statement noted that \u201chundreds of millions\u201d of people, including performers and storytellers, relied on the app as a source of income.\n\nAD\n\nAccording to Forbes, TikTok may suffer a loss of up to $6 billion as a result of the ban. An entire creative industry has sprung up around the platform.\n\nThe United States\n\nFollowing India\u2019s ban of TikTok and many other Chinese apps, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Fox News last month that the United States was taking privacy issues \u201cvery seriously\u201d and that the Trump administration was \u201ccertainly looking at\u201d doing the same.\n\nAD\n\nPompeo said people should download the app only if they want their \u201cprivate information in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Friday, Trump said, \u201cAs far as TikTok is concerned, we\u2019re banning them from the United States.\u201d\n\nByteDance has defended its privacy measures, saying that the data of U.S. users is stored on American soil and that content and moderation policies in the United States are led by a team based in the United States who are not influenced by China or its government.\n\nAustralia\n\nAustralia\u2019s government is conducting investigations into the app, according to media reports. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported that Trump ally Prime Minister Scott Morrison has instructed the country\u2019s intelligence agencies and its Department of Home Affairs to investigate the app\u2019s potential security threat and its data and privacy policies.\n\nThe European Union\n\nThe European Union hasn\u2019t issued any formal warning or ban on TikTok, but the app has come under scrutiny from the bloc\u2019s data protection watchdogs, who launched a probe into its privacy policies in mid-July. The concern from one of the strictest international bodies on data protection echoed those of other countries who were investigating how the app utilizes and records user information.\n\nJapan\n\nA team of lawmakers in Japan are reportedly building a case to take to the Japanese government in September to urge officials to examine Chinese apps in the country and their handling of user data amid growing concerns over privacy.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJapanese lawmakers from the country\u2019s ruling Liberal Democratic Party say personal information must be protected and are seeking to restrict the use of TikTok and other Chinese-owned apps, despite their growing popularity among Internet users in the country.\n\nTurkey\n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdogan has long sought to tighten his grip on social media, with parliament recently passing legislation that effectively bans Facebook, Twitter and YouTube from operating unless they comply with government plans to regulate key platforms.\n\nFrom October, all major social media platforms must have a responsive local representative in the country who can comply with court orders and block or take down posts deemed problematic by the government.\n\nAD\n\nAnadolu Agency, Turkey\u2019s state-run news company, announced last month that the country\u2019s Personal Data Protection Authority had began an investigation into TikTok and how the platform handles personal data.\n\nIndonesia\n\nPrivacy and geopolitical tension with China are not the only reasons TikTok has run afoul of governments. Indonesia temporarily banned the app in 2018, citing concerns including \u201cpornography, inappropriate content and blasphemy.\u201d The ban was lifted less than a week later after the app agreed to censor some of its content.\n\nPakistan\n\nPakistan\u2019s government issued a \u201cfinal warning\u201d to TikTok in July over concerns similar to those of Indonesia, saying the app would be blocked in the country if it did not remove \u201cimmoral, obscene, and vulgar content\u201d from the platform.

And, in the process, Dagestan became a point of reference for questions on the overall tallies in Russia, which reports the world\u2019s fourth-largest number of confirmed cases but a mortality rate that is about a fifth that of U.S. per capita figures, according to Johns Hopkins University data.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor the Kremlin, its claims of a low death rate are hailed as a tribute to Russia\u2019s medical system and the leadership of President Vladimir Putin. Any attempts to challenge that narrative \u2014 such as whether coronavirus cases and deaths are often misclassified \u2014 are quickly slapped down by Putin\u2019s government.\n\nBut Dagestan\u2019s recount is much harder for Moscow to dismiss.\n\nResponding to local pressure, Dagestan\u2019s health minister acknowledged in a May 16 interview with a local blogger that the official coronavirus numbers were likely a sliver of the reality. At the time, Dagestan was reporting about 3,500 confirmed cases and just 29 deaths.\n\nThe health minister, Dzhamaludin Gadzhiibragimov, then said the total number of people infected with coronavirus and community-acquired pneumonia exceeded 13,000, with more than 650 dead.\n\nCount questions\n\nThe reason for the disconnect: Dagestan was counting coronavirus and pneumonia separately because of insufficient testing capacity. (More than two months after Gadzhiibragimov\u2019s admission, Dagestan\u2019s official numbers \u2014 445 deaths and approximately 9,300 cases \u2014 are still lower than those he first quoted.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEven so, the case of Dagestan points to wider debates over Russia\u2019s counting methodology, especially the possibility of deaths from coronavirus-infected patients being attributed to related causes, such as pneumonia.\n\n\u201cIf you go to dinner with 10 people in Dagestan now, probably seven would say they had coronavirus,\u201d said Ziyatdin Uvaisov, the head of Patient Monitor, a Dagestan-based nongovernmental aid organization.\n\nRussia has lifted most of its coronavirus-related restrictions, saying its infection curve has peaked. In a meeting with government health officials Wednesday, Putin said \u201cthe number of new cases is now practically two times lower than what it was during the peak period in May\u201d but cautioned that \u201cthe situation remains difficult; it could swing in any direction.\u201d\n\nKremlin's prized statistic\n\nThe figure the Kremlin touts most often is its low mortality rate, with around 14,000 deaths attributed to the coronavirus. That\u2019s a 1.7 percent case fatality rate, well below Britain\u2019s 15.2 percent at the top of the list, according to Johns Hopkins data. On Friday, the United States was 13th at 3.4 percent, just above Honduras.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut Alexey Raksha, a demographer who worked for Russia\u2019s state statistics agency Rosstat until last month, has been publicly questioning that number since May.\n\nHe suspects the real number of fatalities through the end of July is 50,000, a projection based largely on how many excess deaths he said Russia has had this year as compared with the average of the past five years.\n\nIf Raksha is right, that would put Russia behind only the United States and Brazil for the most coronavirus deaths.\n\nAt issue, Raksha said, is the narrow classification often used for attributing a death to the coronavirus. For example, if a coronavirus-infected person with heart disease died, the cause might be ascribed to the heart disease and not the coronavirus.\n\nAD\n\nRosstat\u2019s May numbers, which were released on July 10, cited 7,444 people dying in Russia because of the coronavirus, but an additional 5,008 people \u2014 counted separately even though they were diagnosed with covid-19 \u2014 died of other illnesses that developed in large part because of the disease, or from unrelated causes.\n\nEven with the numbers divided into separate categories, the statistic agency\u2019s figures are higher than those put out by Russia\u2019s main government-run coronavirus website. It said 3,686 people died of the coronavirus in May.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt just shouldn\u2019t be that the number of newly discovered cases would be the same or nearly the same every day,\u201d Raksha said. \u201cI\u2019m a statistician. I know how actual figures look like and they\u2019re really volatile. Except for maybe Moscow, the statistics on this website are just absolute crap.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nRussia has been sensitive to scrutiny of how it counts coronavirus deaths.\n\nIn May, the Foreign Ministry condemned some foreign media for reporting that the country\u2019s coronavirus death toll might be much higher than government officials were saying. When asked why the mortality rate was so low in Russia, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told CNN in June: \u201cHave you ever thought about the possibility of Russia\u2019s health-care system being more effective?\u201d\n\nRaksha, who first published his suspicions on Facebook before speaking to the New York Times, said he was reprimanded for his comments and then eventually pressured to resign from his position at Rosstat. The agency did not return requests for comment.\n\n'They're afraid'\n\nRaksha said that for the month of June, of the 60 Russian regions that were expected to upload their registration statistics \u2014 things such as births, deaths, marriages and divorces \u2014 to Rosstat, half of them did not. Some regions provided the numbers for everything but deaths, he said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThey were probably too afraid, because there were too many deaths and they\u2019re afraid to be punished,\u201d he said.\n\nIn Dagestan, Magomed Magomedov, editor of the independent Chernovik newspaper in the capital, Makhachkala, said local officials initially didn\u2019t want \u201cto worry the population\u201d with reports of the outbreak spreading rapidly.\n\n\u201cThat was the reason why, at the beginning, people here didn\u2019t take the infection seriously,\u201d Magomedov added. \u201cBut then when people started dying in mass and we had 600 or 700 new patients in the hospital, it wasn\u2019t possible to hide this information anymore.\u201d\n\nWithin days after the health minister\u2019s interview in May made headlines in Moscow, Putin had a nationally televised video meeting with Dagestani officials. One official described the situation as a \u201ccatastrophe\u201d and asked for the government\u2019s assistance.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut by then, at least 40 front-line health workers in the region had died on duty, Gadzhiibragimov, the health minister, said. Hospitals were lacking personal protective equipment, so it was up to aid organizations and residents to provide it.\n\nWhen aid from Moscow finally came, some considered it already too late.\n\nUvaisov, of the Patient Monitor aid organization, wondered how many lives might have been saved had Dagestan been more forthright about its infection figures from the beginning.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that because many cases were classified as pneumonia and not covid, the federal center did not receive any reliable information about the number of covid cases in Dagestan,\u201d he said. \u201cIt looked like the number was relatively low, and that was why we didn\u2019t get enough assistance from the federal center when we really needed it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD"}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/colombias-long-virus-lockdown-fuels-anxiety-and-depression/2020/08/05/80355b70-d729-11ea-a788-2ce86ce81129_story.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=wp_world", "published": "2020-08-05T14:39:44", "title": "Colombia\u2019s long virus lockdown fuels anxiety and depression", "text": "Isolation orders have been extended repeatedly as cases continue to rise and a limited economic reopening that began in April has inched forward only slightly.

Psychologists have seen a dramatic rise in new patients complaining of anxiety and depression. Divorce lawyers say they are getting more inquiries, although clients also discover they cannot afford to separate.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cFrom one moment to the next, my life changed,\u201d said Myriam Roncancio, 35, who is living with her parents after breaking up with her husband. \u201cA 180-degree turn.\u201d\n\nHealth experts say Colombia and a handful of other places in Latin America with especially long lockdowns have been moderately successful in using the time to slow infections, boost testing and expand ICU capacity. But they also worry about quarantine fatigue just as cases reach their peak, and they say more should be done to stress commonsense protections.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019m worried about middle- to low-income countries where it seems quarantine is the main strategy,\u201d says Andr\u00e9s Vecino, a health economist at John Hopkins University. \u201cAnd that creates a problem because in the medium term, it gets exhausted.\u201d\n\nThe long lockdown is essentially a result of timing: Colombia and much of South America imposed the strict measures when they had far fewer cases than Europe. Quarantines in Europe have steadily been lifted as confirmed cases have dropped, although some countries in Africa are still locked down.\n\nAD\n\nBut in Latin America -\u2013 now an epicenter in the pandemic -\u2013 reports of infections are continuing to climb.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to go at the same velocity as Europe,\u201d said Carlos Alvarez, a clinical trial coordinator for the World Health Organization in Colombia. \u201cBut the moment of the pandemic was different.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nA map by researchers at the University of Oxford tracking government response measures shows much of the world in an accordion-like dance of opening and closing to various degrees, while a considerable part of South America remains stuck.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the only region -\u2013 but it is more true in Latin America than many other parts of the world, I\u2019d say,\u201d said Thomas Hale, a professor spearheading the project.\n\nOutside the region, a few other parts of the world remain continuously confined.\n\nIn Africa, where cases are rising, several countries have imposed strict measures. South Africa, with more than 500,000 cases, has banned the sale of alcohol and cigarettes, closed bars and imposed a nighttime curfew. Masks are mandatory in public areas, with fines imposed on those who ignore the regulation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTo be sure, even Colombia\u2019s nationwide \u201cpreventative obligatory isolation\u201d was never as deep and strict as quarantines elsewhere. There are now 46 exceptions that allow people to leave home for various activities.\n\nPeru gave up on isolation measures after three months due to the severe economic cost and high number of informal workers flouting the quarantine. Others like Brazil and Mexico never closed entirely.\n\nBut many Colombians like Nilva Rodriguez, 50, in Barranquilla, have scarcely left their homes. Only twice in four months has she been outside the house she shares with her elderly parents, brother, his pregnant wife and a teenage child.\n\nWhen she talks to relatives in Miami, she says they are stunned to learn that she cannot even go to a nearby beach because it remains closed.\n\nAD\n\nHer mother, accustomed to going to church each day, has grown depressed and complains that virtual Mass just isn\u2019t the same. Her father sometimes gets irritable. Everyone has staked out a part of the house for themselves.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cEvery month has its drama, its situation,\u201d she says.\n\nCalls to a Bogota hotline to report domestic violence have more than doubled since before quarantine. The mayor\u2019s office has set up a mobile brigade operating around the clock to respond to mental health crises. A city phone service offering psychological support has gotten nearly 25,000 calls during the lockdown.\n\nMiguel Antonio Duarte, a psychologist in Bogota, said he has twice as many patients. They include men with anger-management issues and women looking to end relationships.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis context has allowed women to finally realize they are being mistreated,\u201d he said.\n\nConversely, the lockdown has also made it more difficult for many women to report domestic abuse and file for divorce, said lawyer Jimmy Jim\u00e9nez.\n\nIn Bogota, residents are allowed out for certain nonessential activities only on odd or even days of the week, depending on the last number of their national identification cards. Because many also work from home, that means little time to escape from an abusive spouse. Those seeking divorces quickly realize they can\u2019t afford it, barely able to pay rent, utilities and food bills as a family unit.\n\nAD\n\nAs a result, many strained couples stay together, sleeping in separate rooms.\n\nAD\n\nThe escalating mental strain is happening in a country where many already feel anxiety, depression or post-traumatic stress related to Colombia\u2019s long civil conflict -\u2013 and where there is considerable stigma around psychological ailments.\n\n\u201cThis is a country with the traumas of war, drug trafficking, violence,\u201d said Dr. Omar Cu\u00e9llar, the director of a private mental health clinic in Bogota. \u201cIt\u2019s a hotbed in which very easily any new circumstance can make things that much worse.\u201d\n\nColombia has significantly increased virus testing and expanded ICU capacity by almost 40% since the outbreak began \u2014 advancements that officials say have allowed it to avoid a total collapse of the health care system.\n\nAD\n\nYet experts like Dr. Luis Jorge Hern\u00e1ndez, a public health professor at the University of the Andes, worry about the harmful side effects of asking people to stay inside for so long, like lower vaccination rates and worsening cardiac disease in those already mostly sitting indoors.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe quarantine is causing a lot of damage,\u201d he said.\n\nPresident Iv\u00e1n Duque says the country is moving toward more focused quarantines. Bogota is instituting stricter lockdowns in certain neighborhoods for two-week periods. The mayor also is requiring those who are obese or with certain chronic diseases to stay indoors.\n\nThe Americas branch of the WHO put out a strict call last week for nations not to reopen until their cases are declining.\n\nFor Roncancio, whose marriage of 10 years ended abruptly, life has been on hold.\n\nAfter she lost her job as a restaurant administrator at the start of the outbreak and her husband lost his as a baggage handler at Bogota\u2019s airport, they were unable to pay their rent and their quarreling became more frequent.

Beirut was split in half during the 1975-1990 civil war, and in the years since has been rocked by a war with Israel, targeted killings and terror attacks.\n\nBut Tuesday\u2019s explosion was the worst the city has ever seen.\n\nChildren were among the thousands rushed to hospitals, where many patients had to be treated in hallways and parking lots once the wards filled up.\n\nElie Khoueiry, a 38-year-old father of two, said he\u2019s had enough.\n\nAD\n\nHe estimates the blast caused up to $20,000 worth of damage to his pub, where business was already suffering because of the economic crisis and a coronavirus lockdown.\n\n\u201cIf the ruling class wants us to leave, let them give us tickets and we will go,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Aya Batrawy contributed to this report from Dubai, United Arab Emirates."}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/mourners-honor-nobel-laureate-and-peace-advocate-john-hume/2020/08/05/b63822f4-d71d-11ea-a788-2ce86ce81129_story.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=wp_world", "published": "2020-08-05T13:15:20", "title": "Mourners honor Nobel laureate and peace advocate John Hume", "text": "But Pope Francis, the Dalai Lama and U2 singer Bono were among those offering tributes to the man seen as the architect of Northern Ireland\u2019s Good Friday peace agreement.\n\n\u201cEven in the darkest moments, when people would have been forgiven for having no hope, John made peace visible for others,\u2019\u2019 Father Paul Farren said. \u201cHis vision revealed what could be, and with time and determination and single-mindedness and stubbornness he convinced others that peace could be a reality.\u2019\u2019\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHume, who died Monday at age 83, shared the 1998 Nobel Peace Prize with the Protestant leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, David Trimble. Their efforts ended the sectarian violence that plagued the region for three decades and left more than 3,500 people dead.\n\nStarting out as a civil rights activist, Hume fought for equal rights in what was then a Protestant-ruled state. But he condemned the Irish Republican Army because he detested violence and said injustice did not merit the taking of even one human life.\n\nAlthough he advocated for a united Ireland, Hume believed change could not come to Northern Ireland without the consent of its Protestant majority. He also realized that better relations needed to be forged between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland and between London and Dublin.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHume created a broad agenda for the discussions, arguing they must be driven by close cooperation between the British and Irish governments. Neutral figures like U.S. mediator George Mitchell oversaw the process, with decisions having to be ratified by public referendums in both parts of Ireland.\n\nIn other words, the people had to be part of the answer.\n\n\u201cWe were looking for revolution and found it in parish halls with tea and biscuits and late-night meetings under fluorescence,\u2019\u2019 a tribute from the singer Bono said. \u201cWe were looking for a negotiator who understood that no one wins unless everyone wins and that peace is the only victory ... We were looking for a great leader and found a great servant. We found John Hume.\u2019\u2019\n\nAD\n\nUnder normal circumstances, Hume\u2019s funeral would have been mobbed. Though the pandemic made that impossible, the family took the opportunity of international attention to stress that if Hume had the opportunity, he\u2019d discuss our \u201ccommon humanity, the need to respect diversity and difference, to protect and deepen democracy, to value education, and to place non-violence at the absolute center.\u2019\u2019\n\nAD\n\nAmid the sadness, there were lighthearted moments. His son, John Hume Jr., pointed out that his father had a few weaknesses.\n\n\u201cHe also kept the Irish chocolate industry in healthy profits for many years. Yorkies, Crunchies, Creme Eggs, Double Deckers, Wispas, you name it, he loved them all,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cWe often found it odd how a man with the intelligence to win a Nobel Prize could seriously believe that Crunchies were less fattening because they are full of air.\u201d"}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/tanzanian-miner-strikes-it-rich-again-with-huge-gem-find/2020/08/05/646a5766-d705-11ea-a788-2ce86ce81129_story.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=wp_world", "published": "2020-08-05T10:21:15", "title": "Tanzanian miner strikes it rich again with huge gem find", "text": "Today\u2019s Headlines\n\nThe most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.\n\nBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy"}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/virus-keeps-tourists-from-africas-great-wildlife-migration/2020/08/05/c2fd1112-d703-11ea-a788-2ce86ce81129_story.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=wp_world", "published": "2020-08-05T10:09:35", "title": "Virus keeps tourists from Africa\u2019s great wildlife migration", "text": "Tour guide Milton Siloma has worked in the world-famous reserve on Kenya\u2019s southern border for 30 years and said he\u2019s never seen it so quiet.\n\n\u201cWe are alone,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are supposed to have thousands and thousands of tourists around watching this phenomenon.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAlthough the absence of tourists makes little difference to the giant herd of wildebeest moving between Kenya and neighboring Tanzania, it\u2019s a serious problem for the park, the local government and the surrounding community.\n\nAD\n\nWithout tourists there is no income from park entry fees, scenic hot air balloon rides \u2014 a specialty of the park \u2014 and tourist lodges.\n\n\u201cCOVID(-19) has really affected so many operations for us here in the reserve in the sense that the revenue, the funds, that the county government was collecting from Maasai Mara National Reserve has gone to zero,\u201d said chief warden James Sindiyo.\n\nThe effect for the people who live on the edge of the park and who rely on tourism is also significant.

Chief warden Sindiyo said some hungry community members have begun to illegally hunt animals in the park for meat and there have been a number of arrests.\n\n\u201cThey kill just because they are desperate to get meat,\u201d Sindiyo said.\n\nThe wardens fear a larger problem could be on the horizon \u2014 poachers trying to take advantage of the situation by targeting the Maasai Mara\u2019s elephants or endangered rhinos."}]}, "theonion": {"link": "http://www.theonion.com/", "articles": []}}}

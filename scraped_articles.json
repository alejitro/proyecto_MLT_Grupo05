Lebanon's Supreme Defence Council said those responsible would face the \"maximum punishment\" possible.\n\nHospitals are said to be overwhelmed and many buildings have been destroyed.\n\nPresident Aoun declared a three-day mourning period, and said the government would release 100 billion lira (\u00a350.5m; $66m) of emergency funds.\n\nA BBC journalist at the scene reported dead bodies and severe damage, enough to put the port of Beirut out of action.\n\nPrime Minister Hassan Diab called it a catastrophe and said those responsible must be held to account.\n\nHe spoke of a \"dangerous warehouse\" which had been there since 2014, but said he would not pre-empt the investigation.\n\nLocal media showed people trapped beneath rubble. A witness described the first explosion as deafening, and video footage showed wrecked cars and blast-damaged buildings.\n\n\"All the buildings around here have collapsed. I'm walking through glass and debris everywhere, in the dark,\" one witness near the port told AFP news agency.\n\nThe blast was heard 240km (150 miles) away on the island of Cyprus in the eastern Mediterranean.\n\nThe explosion comes at a sensitive time for Lebanon, with an economic crisis reigniting old divisions. Tensions are also high ahead of Friday's verdict in a trial over the killing of ex-Prime Minister Rafik Hariri in 2005.\n\n'Glass going down from all over the building'\n\nHadi Nasrallah, eyewitness speaking to the BBC\n\nI saw the fire, but I didn't yet know there was going to be an explosion. We went inside. Suddenly I lost my hearing because apparently I was too close. I lost my hearing for a few seconds, I knew something was wrong.\n\nAnd then suddenly the glass just shattered all over the car, the cars around us, the shops, the stores, the buildings. Just glass going down from all over the building.\n\nLiterally all over Beirut, people were calling each other from different areas kilometres away and they were experiencing the same thing: broken glass, buildings shaking, a loud explosion.\n\nActually we were shocked because usually when it happens, just one area will experience those happenings after an explosion, but this time it was all of Beirut, even areas outside of Beirut.\n\nSunniva Rose, journalist\n\n\"Driving into Beirut early evening when it was still light, it was absolute chaos. The streets were literally covered in glass. It's hard for ambulances to go through - there's bricks, cement slabs. Houses have collapsed.\n\n\"When I got to the port it had been closed off by the army. The army said to stay away in case there was a second explosion.\n\n\"There was still smoke going up into the sky late into the evening. The whole city was black. It was very hard to walk around, people were covered in blood. I saw an 86-year-old woman being treated by a doctor who had just run out of his home with a first aid kit. Cars were entirely smashed by rocks. These old-style houses with big cuts of rock had just fallen down on the street.\n\n\"It's pandemonium in my own flat, all the glass is shattered. The extent of the damage is extreme. Even in a mall 2km away - the whole facade was shattered.\"\n\nWhat is ammonium nitrate?\n\nAmmonium nitrate has a number of different uses, but the two most common are as an agricultural fertiliser and as an explosive.\n\nIt is highly explosive when it comes into contact with fire - and when it explodes, ammonium nitrate can release toxic gases including nitrogen oxides and ammonia gas.\n\nBecause it's so flammable there are strict rules on how to store ammonium nitrate safely - but among the requirements are that the storage site needs to be thoroughly fire-proofed, and there can't be any drains, pipes or other channels in which ammonium nitrate could build up, creating an additional explosion hazard.\n\nHow have other countries reacted?\n\nLebanon's prime minister also called for international help: \"I make an urgent appeal to friendly and brotherly countries... to stand by Lebanon and to help us heal our deep wounds,\" Hassan Diab said.\n\nUK Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted: \"The pictures and videos from Beirut tonight are shocking. All of my thoughts and prayers are with those caught up in this terrible incident.\n\n\"The UK is ready to provide support in any way we can, including to those British nationals affected.\"\n\nUS President Donald Trump sent his deepest sympathies after what he called \"a terrible attack\", and his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo offered assistance, tweeting: \"We are monitoring and stand ready to assist the people of Lebanon as they recover from this horrible tragedy.\"\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption Buildings were shattered, balconies ripped off\n\nFrance said it was sending aid and resources to Lebanon.\n\nIran would \"render assistance in any way necessary\" Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted, while Saudi Arabia expressed its full solidarity with Lebanon.\n\nIsrael said in a statement that it had \"approached Lebanon through international security and diplomatic channels and has offered the Lebanese government medical and humanitarian assistance\".\n\nThe German foreign ministry said the blast had been felt at its embassy in the city.\n\n\"We cannot for the moment exclude German nationals figuring among the dead and wounded,\" it said in a statement.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption A massive recovery effort is under way\n\nWhat's the situation in Lebanon?\n\nLebanon is experiencing political turmoil, with street demonstrations against the government's handling of the worst economic crisis since the 1975-1990 civil war.\n\nMany blame the ruling elite who have dominated politics for years and amassed their own wealth while failing to carry out the sweeping reforms necessary to solve the country's problems. People have to deal with daily power cuts, a lack of safe drinking water and limited public healthcare.\n\nThere has also been tension on the border with Israel, which said last week that it had thwarted an attempt by Hezbollah to infiltrate Israeli territory. But a senior Israeli official has told the BBC that \"Israel has no connection\" to the Beirut blast.\n\nThe blast happened close to the scene of the huge car bombing which killed ex-PM Hariri. Tuesday's blast also came days before the long-awaited verdict in the trial at a special court in the Netherlands of four men accused of orchestrating the attack.\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption The blast struck Beirut's port district and beyond\n\nAre you in Beirut?

to fight climate change.\n\nThey say property owners should be incentivised to upgrade draughty buildings, not just knock them down.\n\nThat is because so much carbon is emitted by creating the steel, cement and bricks for new buildings.\n\nThe campaign by the Architects\u2019 Journal is backed by 14 Stirling Prize winners\n\nIn the past there was a lot of debate about whether it was better for the climate to demolish an old energy-hungry building and build a well-insulated replacement.\n\nBut this is now widely considered a serious mistake because of the amount of carbon emitted during the construction of the new building.\n\nThe Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) estimates that 35% of the lifecycle carbon from a typical office development is emitted before the building is even opened. It says the figure for residential premises is 51%.\n\nThese calculations suggest it will be decades before some new buildings pay back their carbon debt by saving more emissions than they created - and these are decades when carbon must be sharply reduced.\n\nTax breaks\n\nThe Architects' Journal has now given evidence to the Commons Environmental Audit Committee (EAC) on the difference between operational emissions from heating and cooling a building and embodied emissions from creating construction materials.\n\nIt wants the government to change the VAT rules which can make it cheaper to rebuild than to refurbish a standing building.\n\nArchitects' Journal editor Will Hurst said: \u201cThis staggering fact has only been properly grasped in the construction industry relatively recently. We\u2019ve got to stop mindlessly pulling buildings down.\u201d\n\nHe said VAT on refurbishment, repair and maintenance should be cut from 20% to zero to match the typical rate for new-build.\n\nHe continued: \u201cIt\u2019s crazy that the government actually incentivises practices that create more carbon emissions. Also, if you avoid demolition you make carbon savings right now, which we really need.\n\n\u201cIn the past the government argued that the EU would forbid zero VAT on renovation \u2013 but they can't use that excuse now.\u201d\n\nAnd Alex Green, from the British Property Federation, said that sometimes the different VAT level is the key factor in determining whether a building is felled or saved for a new purpose.\n\nExpense\n\nTreasury Minister Jesse Norman previously told MPs that property owners already benefit from a reduced VAT rate on residential construction under certain conditions.\n\nHe said: \u201cGoing further would be very expensive: reducing VAT on all property renovation, repairs and improvements would cost the Exchequer approximately \u00a36bn per year.\n\n\u201cThe government has no plans to review the VAT treatment of construction.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, ministers recently said they would ease planning rules for owners wanting to demolish offices and replace them with new-build homes.\n\nMr Hurst has urged them to rethink that plan. He suggested the Treasury could raise the tax on new-build projects to compensate for tax reductions from refurbished buildings.\n\nHe also suggested planning guidance should create a bias toward refurbishment.\n\nThe Architects\u2019 Journal evidence has been reviewed by the EAC. Its chair, Philip Dunne MP, told BBC News: \u201cPrioritising retrofitting can offer huge benefits.\n\n\"It enhances energy efficiency and boosts skills and green jobs quickly in the UK.

Many were abandoning what remained of their homes, heading for nowhere in particular. It was just as difficult to get past the debris on foot as it was by car.\n\nIt takes a lot to shake Beirut, which has risen and fallen under bombs before. But in a city inured to explosion, this was something new. An economic implosion had left a country on edge. Now a devastating explosion of a dimension that few could comprehend. \u201cWe\u2019re cursed,\u201d said one man, in his early 20s, blood streaming down his wrist from a glass cut. \u201cEven if this was an accident, it\u2019s the last thing we could afford.\u201d\n\nThe last time a blast anywhere near this size had rocked Lebanon was in February 2005, when the former prime minister Rafik Hariri was killed by a car bomb outside a waterfront hotel. More than 15 years later, a result in the trial of his accused killers is due in The Hague on Friday, and there were fears the explosion could be a harbinger of the verdict.\n\n\u201cNothing happens without a reason here,\u201d said Sobhi Shattar, as he swept debris from the front of the former Nissan chief Carlos Ghosn\u2019s house in a well-to-do street. \u201cThis could be a message for everyone to back off.\u201d\n\nThe focus quickly became what had blown up and how, with everybody having a theory. The blast wave was felt as far away as south Beirut, and was heard 80km (50 miles) away in northern Lebanon. There were reports that the sound of the explosion was heard 250km (160 miles) to the west in Cyprus.\n\n\u201cOnly huge quantities of high explosives could do that,\u201d said Riyadh Haddad, a local engineer. \u201cSomething at the port either blew up by itself, or got targeted.\u201d\n\nLike his neighbours in the entertainment district of Gemmayze, Haddad had a lot of work to do to make his house habitable. \u201cLook at it,\u201d he said. \u201cHow do we recover?

Will it be a wake-up call, or will there be a war?\u201d\n\nIn the early aftermath, Lebanese officials were blaming the chaos on a storage of fireworks igniting in a catastrophic accident. That version was debunked by the sheer size of the explosion and reach of the blast wave.\n\nThe Interior minister, Mohamed Fehmi, later told the MTV Lebanon channel that the explosion appeared to have been caused by \u201chuge quantities of ammonium nitrate\u201d being stored at the port.

Blackburn with Darwen council in Lancashire announced it had set up its own team on Tuesday after the national system failed to reach hundreds of its most vulnerable residents.\n\nIn other areas, including Leicester and Liverpool, council workers have been carrying out door-to-door tracing \u2013 but local health officials says incomplete data from the national system is hampering their efforts.\n\nOn Tuesday, researchers from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who modelled scenarios for the reopening of schools, warned that the test and trace system currently reaches around half of contacts and needs to improve dramatically in order to avoid a second wave, which could be bigger than the first.\n\nStarmer calls for renewed focus on testing in today\u2019s article. \u201cAlongside rapid improvements to the test-and-trace system, we need a focus on ensuring testing reaches more of the estimated 70-80% of people who don\u2019t have [coronavirus] symptoms,\u201d he writes.\n\nLabour sources highlighted current spare capacity in the testing system, saying the party would support any reasonable new moves to use that capacity to build a better national picture of the number of asymptomatic cases.\n\nA number of countries have adopted routine asymptomatic testing, including\n\nGermany, Portugal and most successfully, South Korea, which opened public testing to everyone, regardless of symptoms, from February.\n\nStarmer is to step up specific criticism of the government\u2019s systems this month, both on communication and test and trace, warning the government has less than five weeks, rather than months, to get preparations in place to tackle a resurgence of the virus once children across the UK are all back in school.\n\nA functioning test-and-trace system is the key not only to preventing a second wave, but also to unlocking the economy and building public confidence to get children back to school, Labour will warn.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great if the government are committed to getting the schools open, but polling on this hasn\u2019t shifted: parents are still concerned about sending their kids to school, that won\u2019t change without public confidence in the test-and-trace system,\u201d one Labour source said.\n\nIn his Guardian piece, Starmer says schools must be the absolute priority in September, even if that comes at economic and social cost. \u201cYoung people cannot afford another damaging U-turn like the one made by the education secretary in June,\u201d he writes. \u201cThe government must set out a clear plan this time, not just hope for the best. If that means making hard decisions elsewhere, so be it: to govern is to choose.\u201d\n\nThe Labour leader attacked the government\u2019s communications strategy, saying haphazard announcements of new local lockdowns and quarantines, as well as mixed messages on workers returning to offices, had left the public confused and anxious.\n\n\u201cGetting a grip on communications is essential. Reintroducing regular press conferences would help,\u201d he says. \u201cWorking closely with authorities, not governing by diktat, is crucial. There should be an end to anonymous, contradictory briefings to the media.\u201d Starmer\u2019s last comment is a veiled reference to ideas floated and then dismissed such as shielding advice for over-50s and reform of the quarantine system.\n\nLabour\u2019s strategy over the coming month will be to present Starmer as a leader who can work constructively but also set the government specific targets. He warns a new plan must be drawn up to protect care homes during any resurgence of the virus and calls for a redrawing of the furlough scheme to target specific industries.\n\n\u201cThe current one-size-fits-all removal of furlough risks a squeeze on jobs that could hand a P45 to people across the country,\u201d he says, while also criticising the government for spending \u201cuntargeted billions on bonuses for companies who have already brought workers back from furlough, and a stamp duty cut for landlords\u201d.\n\nStarmer, who will visit the lost Labour heartland of Stoke-on-Trent on Wednesday to hammer home his message on the need to protect jobs, said he would support any moves the government took in the coming months to improve the failures he had highlighted.\n\n\u201cThis crisis is bigger than politics. But the reality is that if the government doesn\u2019t use this summer wisely, focusing on driving down the rate of infection, Britain faces a long and bleak winter.\u201d\n\nA government spokesperson said it backed local action to tackle outbreaks, such as the steps taken in Blackburn, but stopped short of promising any imminent further expansion of testing to find asymptomatic cases.\n\nThe Department of Health and Social Care said the most recent scientific advice did not support routine testing to find a symptomatic cases and found regular testing of those without symptoms was only worthwhile among groups most likely to have been exposed to the virus, such as in care settings.\n\n\u201cNHS test and trace is already working \u2013 last week over 80% of those testing positive were reached, with over 75% of their contacts reached as well,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cWe have rapidly built, from scratch, the largest diagnostic testing industry in British history. Over 2.6 million people have been tested in just eight weeks and we have the capacity to carry out more than 330,000 tests per day, growing to 500,000 per day by the end of October.\u201d"}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/aug/04/donald-trump-civil-rights-leader-john-lewis", "published": "2020-08-04T17:25:41", "title": "Trump refuses to praise late civil rights leader John Lewis", "text": "Donald Trump refused to praise the late John Lewis, the Georgia congressman and original Freedom Rider, during his latest one-on-one interview, and also questioned the value of the pivotal Civil Rights Act of the 1960s, which Lewis fought and almost died for.\n\nWhen asked how history would remember the civil rights leader, the president replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know.

When questioned, Trump said he would not object to efforts to rename the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, where the congressman had his skull broken by state troopers on Bloody Sunday, in Lewis\u2019s honor.\n\nHowever, Trump repeatedly rejected opportunities to praise Lewis as Swan pressed him about Lewis\u2019s legacy. When asked whether he found Lewis impressive, Trump replied that he could not \u201csay one way or the other\u201d.\n\n\u201cI find a lot of people impressive, I find many people not impressive.

A friend of the duke questioned how accurate recollections of such events could be, 20 years after they happened.\n\nWalker told the Sun newspaper she recalled Andrew being at Tramp because she accidentally stepped on his foot while dancing.

Ron Johnson (R-WI) introduced a bill that would provide Americans with either $200 per week in unemployment insurance or replace two-thirds of the unemployed American\u2019s income.\n\nBraun explained in a statement in July:\n\nAs a Main Street entrepreneur, I know we need to support those who are still out of work due to the virus and the government response, but we can\u2019t pay anyone more in unemployment than they made at their job. I support a temporary boost in unemployment benefits that fixes this problem without adding trillions in debt or funding D.C. pet projects.\n\nThe Hoosier conservative said that, as states start to open, he wants to ensure that Americans can go back to work in a safe manner.\n\n\u201cWell, in my opinion, states like Wisconsin and Indiana, two biggest manufacturing states per capita, it\u2019s very clear that the biggest impediment to actually bringing unemployment down is the fact that we\u2019re having trouble bringing workers back,\u201d Braun said. \u201cIt\u2019s just difficult to consider getting people back to work on the margin when there\u2019s that kind of benefit out there for staying on unemployment.\u201d\n\nBraun charged that the Democrats\u2019 push for increased carveouts in the coronavirus negotiations would eventually backlash against the Democrat Party.\n\n\u201cI think that is going to sour on the American public,\u201d Braun said.\n\nBraun also said that Democrats hope to sabotage a recovering economy to hurt the Republicans ahead of the 2020 elections.

Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.\n\nTedros announced that the duo who visited China had \u201cconcluded their mission to lay the groundwork\u201d for a more extensive \u201cinternational team\u201d to identify the virus\u2019s origins.\n\n\u201cThe team is actually not back yet, and we obviously haven\u2019t had the chance to debrief them,\u201d Dr. Ryan explained.\n\nAsked about the mission, Ryan said in responding:\n\nThere are gaps in the epidemiological landscape and what is required is going to be a much more extensive retrospective epidemiological study to look at those first cases and clusters in Wuhan and to fully understand the links between those cases so that we can then determine at what point in Wuhan or elsewhere was the animal-human species barrier breached.\n\n\u201cAgain, one must remember that there was a specific surveillance system in place in Wuhan for picking up clusters of atypical pneumonia,\u201d he also said.\n\n\u201cThe fact that that fire alarm was triggered doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that is where the disease crossed from animals into humans,\u201d Ryan added.\n\nState-run media outlets in China swiftly seized on Ryan\u2019s comments to cast doubt on the true origin of the virus.\n\nAccording to health officials, the virus may have originated in Wuhan wet markets, where animals known to transmit coronaviruses are crammed together in putrid conditions and sold for public consumption.\n\nThe Chinese city is also home to the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV), where researchers are known to carry out studies on bat coronaviruses.\n\nIn early January, China closed the wet market believed to be the source of the virus and disinfected with bleach, destroying all microbial evidence at the site, according to a dossier prepared by concerned Western governments, including the U.S., that surfaced in May.\n\nEchoing the intelligence report, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in April accused Beijing of destroying Chinese coronavirus samples collected early, making it far more difficult to trace the virus\u2019s origin.\n\nThe leaked dossier prepared by Western governments concluded that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) intentionally suppressed or destroyed evidence and covered up news about the outbreak to the \u201cendangerment of other countries.\u201d\n\nU.S. intelligence community officers and other Trump administration officials have questioned if the Chinese coronavirus originated in the Wuhan laboratory rather than through contact with an infected animal. The Trump administration has confirmed it is investigating if a Wuhan lab gave birth to the pandemic.\n\nIn 2018, U.S. Embassy officials in China warned about improper safety protocols at Wuhan Institute of Virology, the Washington Post reported in April.\n\nDr. Ryan credited his \u201cChinese colleagues\u201d with carrying out \u201ca lot of excellent scientific work\u201d related to the coronavirus, namely studies and surveillance.\n\nCiting the W.H.O. press office on Monday, the Associated Press (AP) indicated that the duo who traveled to China might not have been able to visit Wuhan.

Yet the debates play an outsize role in campaigns and weigh more heavily on the verdict than their true value deserves.\n\nThere are several more examples, as Breitbart News\u2019s John Nolte demonstrated:\n\nA number of Democrats, including Bill Kristol, are urging that the debates be canceled. A former senior adviser to Hillary Clinton agrees: \u201cBiden shouldn\u2019t feel obligated to throw Trump a lifeline by granting him any debates at all. This is not a normal presidential election and Trump is not a legitimate candidate,\u201d Zac Petkanas tweeted last week. And then there\u2019s Thomas Friedman, an anti-Trump New York Times columnist, who urged Biden just last week not to debate the president unless Trump agrees to \u201ctwo conditions.\u201d Of course those conditions are ridiculous \u2014 Trump must release his tax returns and agree to \u201creal-time fact checking\u201d during the debate \u2014 and will never be agreed to, and therefore ensure there will be no debates.\n\nNonetheless, establishment media figures are toeing the party narrative alongside the Biden campaign, contending that the push to cancel debates is nothing more than a brainchild of the GOP and Trump allies alike.\n\nThe Washington Post\u2019s Dave Weigel referred to the \u201c\u2019Biden wants to cancel the debates\u2019 meme\u201d as a \u201cTV invention,\u201d and CNN\u2019s own Brian Stelter referred to the subject as \u201cmostly a right-wing media tempest, fueled by hour after hour of Fox commentary (not reporting), far removed from campaign reality,\u201d despite his own network serving as a platform for progressive advocates of the proposal.\n\nThe three presidential debates are currently scheduled for Tuesday, Sept. 29; Thursday, Oct. 15; and Thursday, Oct. 22.", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/08/04/joe-biden-team-trump-allies-touting-imaginary-controversy-about-biden-dodging-debates/", "published": "2020-08-04T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Donald Trump: Beruit Explosion \u2018Looks Like a Terrible Attack\u2019", "text": "President Donald Trump reacted to the massive explosion in Beruit, Lebanon, on the capital city\u2019s waterfront.\n\n\u201cIt looks like a terrible attack,\u201d Trump said during a press conference at the White House on Tuesday.\n\nHe said that he met with his generals to discuss the explosion and they estimated the explosion was an attack.\n\n\u201cThis was not some kind of manufacturing explosion type of event,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThis was a \u2013 seems to be, according to them.

India and Pakistan both claim the territory and have fought two wars and a smaller conflict over its borders. An armed insurgency against Indian rule has continued for more than three decades.\n\nAD\n\nLast August, the Indian government launched a massive crackdown. It restricted all movement, detained thousands of people \u2014 including Kashmir\u2019s political leaders \u2014 and cut off all communications.\n\nThe steps were necessary, it said, to prevent violent protests and avert possible attacks by militant groups it accuses Pakistan of supporting. Pakistan denies the allegations.\n\nAD\n\nThe Internet ban lasted more than 200 days, the longest such shutdown by a democracy. Even now, high-speed Internet has not been restored in the Kashmir Valley, home to more than 8 million people.\n\nHundreds of Kashmiris have been imprisoned under a draconian public safety law or face legally murky forms of house arrest. Schools in Kashmir have barely functioned since last August. They were ordered shut as part of India\u2019s crackdown and then again during the pandemic.\n\nAD\n\nBusiness losses through June are estimated at more than $5 billion, according to the Kashmir Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Attacks by anti-India militants continue, as does cross-border shelling between India and Pakistan.\n\nAD\n\nThe impact of India\u2019s policies has been \u201cdisastrous,\u201d a group of retired Indian judges and civil servants wrote in a recent report. They alleged \u201csystematic violations of human rights\u201d in the region since Aug. 5, 2019.\n\nThree Kashmiris described their experiences over the past year in interviews with The Washington Post. Their accounts have been condensed and edited for clarity.\n\nThe politician\n\nWaheed ur Rehman Para, 32, a leader of the Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Democratic Party, a pro-India political party, who was detained last year and remains under house arrest:\n\nI was arrested on Aug. 5. From the police station I was sent to a detention center. About 30 other people from mainstream political parties were brought in. We stayed there for almost three months.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThen we were shifted to a hostel for members of the state legislature and kept there for the next three months. I have been under house arrest ever since.\n\nOn the first day back home, lots of people came to meet me. Five cops arrived and told me I am not allowed to leave the house. When I tried to leave, they threatened to take me back to detention. They are outside my home 24 hours a day.\n\nThe intent behind our illegal detention was to not allow us to speak and to create an illusion of peace. It was also to send a message to Kashmiris: \u201cWe can do what we want. If we can detain the mainstream leaders and the three [former] chief ministers, we can detain anyone.\u201d That tells you a lot.\n\nAD\n\nAt the detention center, there were two people to a room. Our families could meet us once a week after asking permission. We were not allowed to step outside on the grass. We used to walk the corridors for hours. That was our space. We had only the freedom of being able to walk in a corridor.\n\nAD\n\nEverything was being heard. Cameras and microphones were very visible. It was all under surveillance. Mobile phones were not working, no one [except family members] was allowed to meet us. We felt helpless.\n\nWhat has Delhi actually achieved with this decision? The whole democratic space has been diminished. Have they achieved development? Have they achieved peace? Have they achieved normalcy? Have they achieved anything, other than polarizing people in the country?\n\nAD\n\nWe feel a sense of suffocation at the personal level and political level. I think that has been the worst part of it. You could not talk, you could not speak. You can see and watch things going on \u2014 things happening to you \u2014 and you are not being consulted anywhere. Leaders are actually scared to talk. It\u2019s too risky.\n\nThe government thinks silence is a victory. But in a democracy, if people are silent, then that is the biggest protest.\n\nThe entrepreneur\n\nAdil Sathu, 35, founder of an online travel portal, TripShope:\n\nAD\n\nI run a business-to-business travel portal. I started it in 2015. We had a thousand travel agents in Kashmir working with us. They would come to our website to book airline tickets and hotel rooms. We provide them with credit and pay a commission. It was the first such portal in Kashmir.\n\nAD\n\nOn Aug. 5, I watched in horror as my years of hard work disappeared. I had built my company bit by bit, against the odds in a place like Kashmir. That day changed it completely.\n\nOur work is entirely based on the Internet, and without it, we became completely dysfunctional.\n\nAfter a month without Internet, we moved our office from Kashmir to Delhi. We moved to Jammu at the end of October. I was so fed up of shifting my staff that I almost called it a day. Just for a basic facility like Internet, me and my staff were traveling thousands of kilometers like refugees. It was really humiliating.\n\nAD\n\nI was totally depressed at that time. I could not see my future. I didn\u2019t know what to do.\n\nAD\n\nWe suffered financial losses of over $65,000. I had to lay off staff. I had taken bank loans to start this travel portal. We are going backward day by day. Now because of covid we are suffering again.\n\nThe irony is that now India-based travel agents don\u2019t find us a reliable partner. They say Kashmir is unpredictable and there can be another communication blackout anytime, which is not good for business. But Indians are the ones who hailed Aug. 5 as a moment of a new dawn for Kashmir. When is the new dawn?\n\nThe daughter\n\nIram Khan, 37, whose father was killed in a shootout between security forces and militants:\n\nAll I know is that over the past year, the situation has turned bad in Kashmir. We all have grown up with memories of violence. When I was in seventh grade, there was a small get-together at a relative\u2019s house. We were expecting some guests, including a woman who was seven months pregnant. There was some tension in the area. Paramilitary forces shot her. She died on the spot.\n\nAD\n\nI never thought that my family would go through a similar tragedy.\n\nI was at home in Srinagar [on July 1] when I received a call from my mother. She told me Papa has died in a car accident. She was sobbing.\n\nI knew my youngest son, Iyaad, had accompanied my father, Bashir Ahmad Khan. I was sure that he must have died along with my father.\n\nWhen I reached my parents\u2019 home, the neighbors told me instead that my father had been shot. Then one showed me a picture of Iyaad, which had gone viral by that time. He was sitting on my father\u2019s dead body, crying.\n\nThe cops told my brother that our father was killed in the crossfire after militants attacked a vehicle of the CRPF [Central Reserve Police Force]. But we were suspicious of the police version of events. Our father\u2019s car did not have a single scratch on it.\n\nAD\n\nThe inspector general of police has assured us they will conduct an inquiry, but nothing has happened so far. I have little hope. There is no possibility of justice in Kashmir.\n\nI have been to the spot where my father was killed and talked to people living nearby. All they said was that they had heard a child crying. Even if they had seen something, they wouldn\u2019t say it. I know they are afraid.\n\nIyaad doesn\u2019t understand what death is. He still asks for Papa. Yesterday, I went out to do some work, and he asked me, \u201cAre you going to bring Papa home?\u201d He asks everyone when Papa will come back.\n\nI won\u2019t blame any side. But people are sad. There is no happiness anywhere in Kashmir. Every household has a painful story."}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/islamic-state-attack-on-an-afghan-prison-stretches-into-its-second-day-with-21-dead/2020/08/03/69e7146e-d556-11ea-a788-2ce86ce81129_story.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=wp_world", "published": "2020-08-03T08:10:00", "title": "Islamic State attack on Afghan prison ends on second day, with at least 29 dead", "text": "At least 29 people, including civilians, security forces and inmates, were killed and 49 wounded in the course of the raid, according to the provincial governor's office. Those tolls are expected to rise as bodies are recovered from the prison.\n\nAD\n\nThe Islamic State asserted responsibility for the assault, the most ambitious operation the group has mounted in Afghanistan since it officially established a branch in the country in 2015. It follows the announcement Saturday by Afghanistan's main intelligence agency that the militant group's intelligence director had been killed near Jalalabad.\n\nAD\n\nThe attack also comes at a tense moment, as pressure builds to bring the Taliban and Afghan government together for peace talks. It began just hours before a confidence-building cease-fire was set to end, and the complex planning it entailed prompted suspicions among Afghan officials of Taliban involvement despite a statement from the group denying responsibility.\n\nBait and switch\n\nThe assault started when a car bomb targeting the prison's main gate detonated just after 6:30 p.m. Sunday, killing three policemen. But as Afghan security forces rushed to the scene, one group of gunmen took over a high-rise building abutting the complex while a second group launched another attack from the back of the prison, using rocket-propelled grenades to blast through a perimeter wall bordering a residential neighborhood.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"The car bomb was just a distraction,\" said a local Afghan security official who was at the scene. \"There is no way they could have entered through the main gate. It's too fortified. The back of the prison, that was the weak point.\"\n\n\n\nThe official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media, said it is thought the attack was carried out by 20 to 30 men. He said the relatively small group was able to take over the sprawling complex because the men coordinated with prisoners inside. \"They knew exactly where they were going,\" he said. The gunmen overpowered the prison guards, began dividing up prisoners and raided the complex's weapons stores, handing weapons out to some of the prisoners.\n\nA second Afghan official, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity, confirmed that account.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHekmatullah, a prisoner wounded in the attack, said that after the initial explosion, prison guards locked the inner gates, but that just an hour later, gunmen in camouflage uniforms managed to enter.\n\nThe assailants started yelling at the prisoners, \"Leave or we will shoot you,\" said Hekmatullah, who like many Afghans goes by one name. Once the assailants began firing, prisoners ran in all directions, and that's when he was shot, he said. He was taken to a hospital for treatment.\n\nOnce inside the prison, the gunmen raised an Islamic State flag over one of the towers, Hekmatullah said.\n\nThe prison held more than 1,700 inmates at the time of the attack, including fighters with links to the Islamic State and the Taliban, as well as criminals, according to the first official. As of Monday evening, more than 330 inmates remained at large, he said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe assault quickly turned into a standoff because the heavily armed militants perched atop the nearby high-rise had a direct line of sight to the complex\u2019s main entrance and courtyard. Afghan forces were able to enter the prison only after they cleared the packed high-rise, which houses shops, offices and apartments.\n\nEven then, they had to move slowly because intelligence reports warned that the attackers planned to detonate explosives once government forces entered the prison.\n\nAfter the blasts that rocked the complex during the clearing operation, the bodies of six suicide bombers were recovered.\n\n\u201cThe attackers knew their plan. It was very sophisticated,\u201d the first official said.\n\nDisputed claims\n\nAfghan officials have repeatedly alleged links between the Taliban and the Islamic State, claiming that the groups aid each other in staging attacks and share training pipelines. After the Jalalabad assault, Afghanistan\u2019s interior minister echoed those allegations in a tweet, saying that when the Haqqani network and Taliban fighters carry out attacks that do \u201cnot suit them politically they rebrand it under\u201d the Islamic State.\n\nWhile evidence of direct links is flimsy, the long-held theory highlights the depths of distrust between the Afghan government and the Taliban movement and threatens progress toward formal peace talks.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Jalalabad prison operation was almost identical to past Taliban attacks. A Taliban raid on a prison in Ghazni in 2015 that freed more than 350 prisoners also began with a car bomb that breached the complex\u2019s perimeter before gunmen stormed the buildings.\n\nFor months, Afghan officials have feared that Taliban fighters displeased with the group\u2019s participation in peace talks would join the Islamic State, potentially bringing battlefield expertise and tactics with them.\n\nConcerns about Taliban involvement in the attack touch on questions regarding the Taliban\u2019s intention to uphold counterterrorism assurances and the ability of the Taliban political leadership in Qatar to control the group\u2019s fighters on the ground. Both issues are becoming increasingly important in the lead-up to peace talks.\n\nAfghan President Ashraf Ghani did not accuse any single group of carrying out the attack, but in a Facebook post Monday, he called it a \u201cbarbaric act . . . a crime against humanity and contrary to the Islamic values.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nUntil the Sunday night attack, the cease-fire marking the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha had largely held. The truce was intended as a confidence-building measure to aid in the push for direct peace talks. After the signing of the U.S.-Taliban peace deal, intra-Afghan negotiations have been delayed for months by an escalation of violence and a controversial prisoner swap.\n\nThe Islamic State was not a party to the cease-fire, and Sunday\u2019s attack would probably not constitute a violation of the truce. But it highlights the kind of violence that could continue in Afghanistan even in the event of a peace deal with the Taliban.\n\nAfghanistan\u2019s Islamic State offshoot has asserted responsibility for several recent attacks in Kabul in which gunmen stormed buildings and held off security forces for hours. But the group has largely focused on civilian targets in areas that are home to religious and ethnic minorities, rather than highly fortified government buildings.\n\nThe Taliban and Afghan government officials are still wrangling over a controversial prisoner swap that has emerged as a key stumbling block to peace talks.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe U.S.-Taliban peace deal called for the release of prisoners on both sides before the launch of intra-Afghan peace talks. Now, months overdue, the Afghan government announced it would release 5,000 prisoners as the Taliban demanded before talks could begin. But the sides remain at odds over who should be included in the 5,000. Taliban officials seek the release of hundreds of fighters linked to deadly high-profile attacks, a move opposed by government officials and international human rights organizations."}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/why-tiktok-was-destined-to-land-in-trumps-crosshairs/2020/08/04/e0526798-d56f-11ea-a788-2ce86ce81129_story.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=wp_world", "published": "2020-08-04T09:31:00", "title": "Why TikTok was destined to land in Trump\u2019s crosshairs", "text": "So the battle over viral short-video app TikTok is not about its current reach to American teens, but the potential reach of this catchy communication format from China.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTikTok\u2019s parent company, ByteDance, is in talks to sell its U.S. business to Microsoft, after unsuccessful attempts to allay U.S. regulatory concerns about Beijing\u2019s surveillance and censorship.\n\n\n\n\u201cCFIUS determined that ByteDance must fully divest TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations,\u201d ByteDance chief executive Zhang Yiming wrote to employees in an email Monday, using the acronym for the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. \u201cWe disagree with CFIUS\u2019s conclusion.\u201d\n\n\n\nAD\n\nZhang wrote that ByteDance\u2019s executives \u201cunderstand their decision in the current macro environment.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a measure of how much the U.S.-China business landscape has changed, that Microsoft may now be TikTok\u2019s best prospect. In 2008, Zhang, the future ByteDance founder, got a job at Microsoft but quit months later, finding work there unstimulating.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t anything really bad,\u201d he said about his time at Microsoft, in a video interview with China\u2019s Caishi Media years later. \u201cIt was just boring. I could basically read half the day and work half the day.\u201d\n\n\n\nAt the end of 2018, ByteDance became the world\u2019s most valuable start-up, and it has retained the title since. The company says it has 100 million users in the United States, a reach that has brought the issue of Chinese government censorship to America\u2019s doorstep.\n\n\n\nAD\n\nNo other Chinese social media platform has gained anywhere near such a following in the West. Weibo and Renren never got far beyond localized imitations of Twitter and Facebook, which were banned in China. WeChat, China\u2019s chat app of choice, was a bona fide innovator, years ahead of Facebook in integrating mobile payments, small group chats, stickers and other features into its messaging platform.\n\n\n\nStill, WeChat never felt native outside of China, even putting aside the issue of surveillance by an authoritarian government. Some of its most useful domestic features, like mobile payments and ride-hailing, had limited functionality abroad. WeChat\u2019s walkie-talkie-like function also had limited draw overseas, though it made sense in a country without an alphabet and where 3 percent of the population is illiterate and far more don\u2019t know how to type on a computer.\n\nAD\n\nThe international version of WeChat remained slightly lost in translation for years, with the \u201ctalk-to-the-hand\u201d emoji, used in China to convey disdain, annotated in English as \u201cwave.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTikTok, though, provided a seamless experience overseas from the get-go \u2014 aided by the universality of short funny videos, a medium that transcends language and borders.\n\n\n\nAs with many other Chinese Internet start-ups, ByteDance has had its battles with Chinese censors. ByteDance\u2019s popular news aggregator app Toutiao has been temporarily suspended by authorities at times.\n\nByteDance\u2019s jokes and memes app, Neihan Duanzi, was shut down in 2018 after Beijing regulators criticized it for vulgar content. Zhang issued an apology and pledged to hire thousands more content reviewers for the company\u2019s other apps.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe product has gone astray, posting content that goes against socialist core values,\u201d he wrote of Neihan Duanzi in the lengthy public apology.\n\n\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDan Wang, a technology analyst at Gavekal Dragonomics, said that the U.S. government has not produced a \u201csmoking gun\u201d that ByteDance has harmed U.S. national security, but it was hard for it or any Chinese tech company to prove that it can be independent from Beijing. U.S. officials say that ByteDance has to comply with China\u2019s censorship, which TikTok denies, saying its servers for international users are in the United States and Singapore.\n\n\u201cIn another era, or with another country, these concerns might have been manageable,\u201d he said. \u201cBut U.S.-China relations are at their worst point in decades.\u201d\n\nTikTok is the latest in a line of new communication technologies that began with simpler intentions but were drawn into politics once they reached a critical mass. Mark Zuckerberg started Facebook to connect fellow students. The founders of Twitter \u2014 then, \u201ctwittr\u201d \u2014 wanted a place for their stream-of-consciousness musings.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRadio was used in the early days by sailors, who before then could only communicate with flags. During the Cold War, pro- and anti-Communist groups found it a useful tool for blasting propaganda across borders.\n\nThe last major wave of anti-China sentiment in the United States unfolded in the 1950s with the popularization of television. The entertainment and media industry came under heavy scrutiny in the McCarthy hearings, as the broad reach of TV and film became apparent.\n\nThe scrutiny of TikTok has come early in the process, with the medium still largely used by teenagers to share dancing videos. Companies and political groups are still figuring out how to use the platform.\n\nAD\n\nBut politics has begun trickling into the mix, both in China and the United States. Muslim Uighurs in China\u2019s oppressive Xinjiang region last year began using the app to share information about detained relatives. Teenagers used the app to falsely inflate projected attendance for Trump\u2019s Tulsa rally.\n\nAD\n\nAnd not least, the teenagers on TikTok today may not yet be voting age, but they will be soon. Their political views are forming, with each click and swipe."}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/08/04/beirut-explosion-ammonium-nitrate/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=wp_world", "published": "2020-08-04T11:35:47", "title": "Here\u2019s what the videos of the Beirut blast tell us about the explosion", "text": "Many not accustomed to seeing large explosions may conflate mushroom clouds and spherical blast waves as nuclear, said Jeffrey Lewis, an arms-control expert and professor at Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey. \u201cBut some of the things we associate with nuclear explosions are just associated with explosions.\u201d\n\nFew things can be concluded from the videos, including some filmed before the bigger of the blasts, which Lewis said may have begun when munitions in storage caught fire.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA rising cloud of white smoke featured crackling and bright pops consistent with when small munitions \u2014 rockets, for instance \u2014 begin cooking off, he said.\n\nThen a fireball erupts, followed by an orb of white that quickly expands from the blast zone. That is the pressure of the shock wave condensing the moisture in the air, he said.\n\nBrian Castner, a former Air Force bomb technician and investigator at Amnesty International, echoed that on Twitter, saying the shock wave \u201cis visible in the humid air.\u201d\n\nLebanese Interior Minister Mohammed Fahmi said it appeared that stocks of ammonium nitrate, a fertilizer that can be used in bombmaking, had exploded.\n\nAD\n\nThe telltale signs of ignited ammonium \u2014 reddish smoke \u2014 spewed from the blast, Lewis said. The color is consistent with the chemical compound and comes from nitrogen oxides, the byproduct of which gives smog its reddish-brown tones.\n\nLebanese Prime Minister Hassan Diab linked the explosions to dangerous stocks of chemicals that had been stored at the port since 2014, despite warnings from port officials that the material was not safe.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI promise you that this catastrophe will not pass without accountability. \u2026 Those responsible will pay the price,\u201d he said in a televised speech. \u201cFacts about this dangerous warehouse that has been there since 2014 will be announced and I will not preempt the investigations.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAround 2,700 tons were stockpiled, Lebanese President Michel Aoun said. That is near back-of-the-envelope estimates of the size of the explosion, which is around the equivalent of a \u201cfew hundred tons of TNT,\u201d Lewis said. Ammonium nitrate is not as powerful as TNT.\n\nIn 2011, a similar explosion occurred in Cyprus after munitions stored there for years exploded, killing at least 12."}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/major-explosion-rocks-beirut/2020/08/04/53ff4dd6-d666-11ea-a788-2ce86ce81129_story.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=wp_world", "published": "2020-08-04T10:45:00", "title": "At least 63 people dead and more than 3,000 injured as explosions rock Beirut, Health Ministry says", "text": "The casualty toll rose through the evening. By midnight, the Health Ministry put the toll at 63 dead and more than 3,000 injured.\n\nHospitals were overwhelmed by the number of injuries. One, the Hotel Dieu, said it had received over 500 injured people in the first hours after the blasts. For more than an hour after the explosions, people with blood streaming down their faces or limbs wandered the streets trying to find a way of reaching hospitals on roads too clogged with traffic and debris for ambulances and taxis to move.\n\nIn the early hours of Wednesday, Red Cross workers were still scouring the wrecked and deserted streets in neighborhoods adjoining the port, calling out to residents who might be trapped and injured to identify themselves.\n\nThe explosions coincide with mounting tensions between Israel and the Lebanese Shiite militia Hezbollah, which maintains a facility at the port and has long been accused by U.S. officials of using it to smuggle weapons into the country. The incident follows a spate of mysterious blasts at Shiite militia weapons storage sites in Iraq last year, which Iraqi and Israeli officials have said Israel was responsible for, and more recently a string of explosions at military sites and sensitive locations in Iran, which regional intelligence officials have said Israel, at least in part, was behind.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAn Israeli official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief reporters, said that Israel had no role in the Beirut explosions. Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz and Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi offered the Lebanese government medical and humanitarian aid as well as immediate emergency assistance, via international intermediaries because Israel and Lebanon are in a state of war and have no official contact.\n\nIn a statement offering condolences to families of the dead and injured, Hezbollah did not apportion blame. It called the incident a \u201chuge national tragedy\u201d and urged Lebanese to unite to overcome the ordeal.\n\nAt a news conference, President Trump called the explosion a \u201cterrible attack\u201d and said U.S. generals seemed to feel that it was the result of a \u201cbomb of some kind.\u201d But military officials said they had yet to make a solid assessment of the explosion.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere were many indications that the blast may have been a tragic accident. Lebanese Interior Minister Mohammed Fahmi said it appeared that stocks of ammonium nitrate, a fertilizer that can be used in bomb making, had ignited.\n\nPrime Minister Hassan Diab linked the explosions to 2,700 tons of the dangerous chemical that had been stored at the port since 2014, despite warnings from port officials that the material was not safe.\n\n\u201cI promise you that this catastrophe will not pass without accountability. . . . Those responsible will pay the price,\u201d he said in a televised speech. \u201cFacts about this dangerous warehouse that has been there since 2014 will be announced and I will not preempt the investigations.\u201d\n\nBut suspicions lingered that Israel may have been involved, said a senior Lebanese army officer who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the issue is sensitive. Numerous witnesses reported hearing warplanes overhead at the time, he noted.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere are suspicions,\u201d the official said. \u201cThere will be no conclusion until there has been a full investigation.\u201d\n\nIsraeli planes and drones have been spotted flying with increasing regularity over the city in recent weeks as the tensions have risen.\n\nOne thing that was clear is that crisis-stricken Lebanon, in the throes of a major economic collapse and battling rising numbers of coronavirus infections, is in little position to cope with another disaster, especially on this scale. At least two hospitals were badly damaged in the explosions, and TV footage showed staff evacuating patients to alternative hospitals that were themselves swamped \u2014 in the dark, because the city had no electricity.\n\nThe Red Cross told all ambulances across the country to head to Beirut to report for duty.\n\nMany residents lost their homes, especially in the majority-Christian eastern part of the city closest to the blast. In the neighborhood of Gemmayze, once a vibrant nightlife district, buildings collapsed, cars were overturned and the streets were blocked by piles of masonry and twisted metal.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe damage was spread across a wide arc. Windows were blown out and check-in counters were damaged at Beirut\u2019s airport, several miles from the explosion. Doors were blown open and windows rattled at the U.S. Embassy, more than six miles away.\n\nHealth officials warned that the explosion had left a toxic cloud of nitrous oxide hanging over the city, and told residents to wear masks and stay indoors. The U.S. Embassy issued a similar warning in a message to U.S. citizens. \u201cThere are reports of toxic gases released in the explosion so all in the area should stay indoors and wear masks if available,\u201d the message said.\n\nAmong the dead was Nazar Najarian, a senior official in the Kataeb political party. The injured included Kamal Hayek, chairman of the state-owned electricity company, according to the state-run National News Agency.\n\nGermany\u2019s Foreign Ministry tweeted that German Embassy employees were among those injured.

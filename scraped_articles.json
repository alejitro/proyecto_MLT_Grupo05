for families during the summer holidays\n\nFree school meals should be extended to another 1.5 million children in England, says a government-commissioned review into food and healthy eating.\n\nThe National Food Strategy warns that the country's eating habits are a \"slow-motion disaster\".\n\nThe review warns of the toxic connection between poor diet and child poverty.\n\nReport author Henry Dimbleby said a nutritious diet was the \"foundation of equality of opportunity\".\n\n\"Unless action is taken to improve our food system, many thousands will continue to suffer,\" said Mr Dimbleby, co-founder of the Leon food chain.\n\nThe negative impacts of growing up hungry are long-lasting and corrosive, says the review, which is claimed as the most significant for decades.\n\n\"One of the miserable legacies of Covid-19 is likely to be a dramatic increase in unemployment and poverty and therefore hunger,\" says the food strategy report.\n\nAs an immediate intervention, the review calls for many more children to be eligible for a free meal at school, as \"only 1% of packed lunches meet the nutritional standards of a school meal\".\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Is the food industry encouraging people towards unhealthy eating habits?\n\nThe review says they should be available to a further 1.5 million children, in addition to the 1.3 million already eligible - so almost one in three children would get free meals.\n\nThe extension of free school meals, at a cost of \u00a3670m per year, would bring them in reach of all children in families claiming universal credit.\n\nSuch a move would aim to stop pupils being hungry at school and prevent the negative consequences for learning and behaviour.\n\nFootballer Marcus Rashford recently raised the profile of the importance of school meals during the summer holidays for families who are struggling financially, forcing a U-turn which will see vouchers continuing over the summer break.\n\nThe food strategy proposes making a long-term commitment to feeding more families over the summer holidays, by making another 1.1 million children in England eligible for the \"holiday activity and food programme\", at a cost of \u00a3200m per year.\n\nPaul Whiteman, leader of the Nation Association of Head Teachers, said there were already too many children who \"arrive at school hungry and unable to learn\".\n\n\"Free school meals at least guarantee that children going hungry at home get one nutritious meal a day,\" he said.\n\nThere are warnings about \"misleading packaging\" of unhealthy products and the report challenges the \"false virtue\" of how the food industry presents itself.\n\nBehind the ethical ambitions, the report suggests there is still a culture of \"unhealthy multi-buy offers\".\n\nMr Dimbleby spoke of some apparently healthy fruit snacks that are \"clothed in a veneer of goodness and might not be better for you than a Mars bar\".\n\nThere are serious consequences, says the review, with one in seven deaths in the UK attributable to poor diets.\n\n\"A nutritionally poor-quality diet is the leading risk factor for ill-health in the UK, yet we do not treat it with the same seriousness afforded to other risk factors.\n\n\"That has to change,\" said Susan Jebb, Oxford University professor of diet and population health, who worked on the report.\n\nThis is the first part of the review, with the second part next year expected to focus on environmental issues, such as climate change, pollution, sustainable farming and the spread of diseases.\n\nEnvironment Secretary George Eustice said the food industry had \"worked round the clock\" to keep supplies going through the Covid-19 lockdown.\n\n\"But we know there is more to do and we will carefully consider this independent report and its recommendations as we emerge from the pandemic and build a stronger food system for the future,\" said Mr Eustice."}, {"link":

This is estimated to cost an extra \u00a3670m a year. Only 1% of packed lunches meet the nutritional standards of a school meal, according to the report.\n\nA nationwide \u00a3200m expansion of holiday hunger schemes currently state-funded in 16 local council areas and reaching 50,000 children. Around 3 million children are at risk of hunger during the school holidays, the report says.\n\nAn expansion of the Healthy Start fresh fruit, milk and vegetables voucher scheme for pregnant mothers, increasing its value and encouraging supermarkets to supplement the voucher with free fresh produce.\n\nThe report concludes that Covid-19 reaffirmed \u201can important principle that in a crisis of this size you need to reinforce the entire societal safety net\u201d.

The manufacturing body Make UK warned that more than half of the manufacturing sector was planning redundancies when the business support schemes ended.\n\nThe LSE report urges the government to put in place an industrial strategy that \u201cmust reflect\u201d the cold reality of \u201cbeing in a post-Brexit UK which is placed in a post-Covid world economy\u201d in which global trade shrinks."}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jul/28/tourist-hotspots-hit-hardest-in-uk-by-covid-19-unemployment", "published": "2020-07-28T21:30:13", "title": "Tourist hotspots hit hardest in UK by Covid-19 unemployment", "text": "Tourist hotspots across the UK are bearing the brunt of the ailing jobs market, an analysis of data on unemployment benefit claims since the Covid-19 lockdown has shown.\n\nFigures from Labour show that in areas heavily reliant on tourism the rise in the number of people seeking unemployment benefits in recent months is an average of 65 percentage points higher than in other areas. The data has prompted Keir Starmer to warn that holiday towns are facing a jobs crisis.\n\nLabour analysed data from the Office for National Statistics showing that in 32 places in England, Wales and Scotland where one fifth or more of the local workforce are in tourism-related jobs, the unemployment benefits claimant count among working-age adults has risen by an average of 174% from February to June \u2013 compared to 109% for the UK as a whole.\n\nThe Labour leader will visit Falmouth, Cornwall, on Wednesday, where 24% of workers are in tourism related jobs and the unemployment claimant count has risen by 140% since lockdown.

New data shows that Google has suppressed Breitbart\u2019s search visibility by 99.7 percent since 2016.\n\nOn April 4, 2016, Breitbart ranked in the top ten search positions (i.e., on the first page of Google search results) for 355 key search terms; but now, as of July 20, 2020, Breitbart ranks in the top ten search positions for only one search term. And, on April 4, 2016, Breitbart ranked in the top 100 search positions for 16,820 key search terms; but now, as of July 20, 2020, Breitbart ranks in the top ten search positions for only 55 search terms.\n\nMoreover, organic Google search traffic to Breitbart (measured by unique visitors) is down 63 percent when comparing the first half of 2016 with the first half of 2020.\n\nThe following chart shows the visibility of Breitbart content in the Google search engine since 2011. It shows that Google has nearly eliminated Breitbart content from its search results.\n\nThe SISTRIX Visibility Index ranks a website\u2019s visibility in Google by looking at its ranking in a million search terms.\n\nA close-up of the visibility decline following Google\u2019s May 2020 core update.\n\nThis foregoing graph also shows three major drops in Breitbart\u2019s search visibility (these drops are highlighted by the bright red lines). The first drop took place shortly after (and inferentially in response to) the 2016 election. The second took place in July of 2019. The third took place in May of this year, after which (1) unless a user types \u201cBreitbart\u201d into the search bar (and even then), they are highly unlikely to get any Breitbart content search results, and (2) Breitbart search results for \u201cJoe Biden\u201d and other Biden-related search terms have gone to zero. Even if you specifically search for Breitbart News headlines, you are unlikely to find them in Google search.\n\nGoogle Just Killed All Search Traffic to Breitbart for Joe Biden and Joe Biden-Related Searches\n\nAfter Google\u2019s May core search update on or about May 5, 2020, Google search impressions and search traffic to Breitbart for \u201cJoe Biden\u201d and other Biden-related search terms has gone to zero. Zero. The following graph clearly illustrates the foregoing.\n\nOn May 1, Google searches for \u201cJoe Biden\u201d generated approximately 30,000 impressions (views, used as a metric for advertisers) for Breitbart links. After May 5, both impressions and clicks went to zero.\n\nBreitbart News spoke to an SEO (Search Engine Optimization) expert, a 25-year industry veteran, whose job consists of analyzing traffic data from Google\u2019s own website performance portal, Google Search Console.\n\nThe expert, who wished to remain anonymous, said he had never seen anything like this graph \u2014 and that it indicates highly probable manipulation on the part of Google.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never experienced such a wholesale removal of rank and visibility on specific concepts on a site as I have seen being applied to Breitbart,\u201d said the expert. \u201cRemoval is the key, not dropping in rank, which would be an organic devaluing. These ranks are just simply gone, overnight, while other topics have been untouched.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe sheer fact that there are thousands of pages of Breitbart content that reference Biden that were ranking before May 6, that now have no rank or impressions on search is a sign of manipulation, not algorithmic devaluing.\u201d\n\nA longer view: Google search traffic to Breitbart News from the search term \u201cJoe Biden\u201d from July 2019 to the present. A regular heartbeat followed by a flatline as the election grows closer.\n\nThe Percentage of Traffic to Breitbart from Google Search (9%) Is Just a Fraction of the Average Publisher\u2019s (30-50%); Expert Believes Breitbart Being Blacklisted\n\nDr. Robert Epstein, a psychologist and former Hillary Clinton supporter who has spent the last half-decade studying the effects of search engine bias on voters, said he believes Breitbart News is currently on one of Google\u2019s blacklists, a topic on which he has written extensively.\n\n\u201cFor news websites large and small, Google \u2014 in combination with its YouTube offshoot \u2014 typically drives between 30 and 50 percent of the traffic to those sites,\u201d Dr. Epstein told Breitbart News via email. \u201cFor the New York Times, the percentage is currently 39.3%. At the moment, Google is responsible for just 9 percent of Breitbart\u2019s traffic, and YouTube is sending a negligible amount, if any. Given the size of Breitbart\u2019s audience, this suggests to me that Breitbart is listed on one or more of Google\u2019s blacklists.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose are the lists that Google denies having \u2014 even under oath in Congressional hearings \u2014 even though two of those blacklists were leaked from the company last year by whistleblower Zach Vorhies.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow many blacklists they actually maintain is unknown, but it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if it\u2019s a hundred or more,\u201d continued Epstein.\n\nDr. Epstein recently told Breitbart News\u2019s Alex Marlow that Google is likely to shift ten percent of voters away from Trump to fulfill its executives\u2019 stated goal of avoiding a repeat of 2016.\n\nThe psychologist has previously explained how Google\u2019s search bias can affect undecided voters by offering them selective information about political candidates. This is because voters are not inclined to suspect search results of bias in the same way that they might suspect a CNN or New York Times report to be biased.\n\nIn testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last year, Epstein warned lawmakers that big tech could influence an extraordinary number of voters without any trace.\n\n\u201cIn 2020 \u2014 if all these [big tech] companies are supporting the same candidate \u2014 there are 15 million votes on the line that can be shifted without people\u2019s knowledge, and without leaving a paper trail for authorities to trace.\u201d\n\nIn a comment to Breitbart News, a Google spokeswoman denied allegations of political bias.\n\n\u201cThere is no validity whatsoever to these allegations of political bias,\u201d said the spokeswoman. \u201cOur systems do not take political ideology into account, and we go to extraordinary lengths to build our products for everyone in an apolitical way. Anyone can easily cherry-pick a range of conservative, progressive or non-political sites that have seen traffic changes over time. The improvements we make to Search undergo a rigorous testing process and are done to provide helpful information for the billions of queries we get every day.\u201d\n\nGoogle Search Rankings Suggest More Wholesale Suppression of Conservative Publishers\n\nBreitbart News isn\u2019t the only conservative news site that has an unusually low position in Google\u2019s search rankings. Alexa data shows that the percentage of traffic to conservative websites that come from Google is far lower than that of corporate media sites.\n\nPercentages of website traffic from Google, via Alexa web rankings. Red = media sources with conservative or libertarian-leaning editorial stances. Data is a six-month average as of July 7, 2020.\n\nEight of the ten lowest-ranked sites (Breitbart News, Fox News, The Daily Caller, The Blaze, Reason, The Federalist, The Daily Wire, the Washington Examiner) in the chart above are conservative.\n\nMeanwhile, all ten of the top-ranked sites, with the arguable exception of heavy.com, are from the corporate, liberal-leaning, or leftist media. Far-left Vox.com is placed third.\n\nThe highest-ranking conservative-leaning news publishers \u2014 the New York Post, the Wall Street Journal, and the British Daily Mail are all newspapers and part of the media establishment and are relatively centrist. Yet even they are far behind leftist outlets like Vox and the Guardian in Google traffic. The top online-only conservative outlets \u2014 Breitbart News, The Daily Caller, and The Blaze \u2014 are all near the bottom.\n\nLast week, several conservatives on social media recently noticed that their articles were not appearing at all in Google search. Breitbart News was similarly affected. Google claimed to have investigated the issue, which the company has attributed to an error, and conservative journalists and websites have reported their search results returning. What last week\u2019s incident shows is Google\u2019s incredible power to control what people do and do not see with the flick of a switch.\n\nBut the data in this article shows that Google\u2019s manipulation of search results, and its systematic undermining of conservative media, has been far more long-running and pervasive than this one incident.\n\nTakeaways\n\nGoogle has stated its intention clearly: to make sure the 2016 election of President Trump was a \u201cblip\u201d in history. Sure enough, with less than five months before the election, Google is manipulating election-related search results. The scope and audacity (and hubris) make any alleged foreign interference in the 2016 election pale by comparison. And, it will surely warrant an even greater post-election congressional scrutiny. It will greatly strengthen the contention of Sens. Josh Hawley (R-MO) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), and of Sens. Tom Cotton (R-AR) and Kelly Loeffler (R-GA), that search result manipulation ought to be a major subject of the Department of Justice\u2019s antitrust investigation into Google. Not surprisingly, when recently asked about political search bias, Vice President Pence told Breitbart News that \u201cwe\u2019re going to watch it closely.\u201d\n\nAre you an insider at Google, Reddit, Facebook, Twitter, or any other company who wants to confidentially blow the whistle on wrongdoing or political bias?

I published a big article on this in 2016 called The New Censorship, I focused on nine of Google\u2019s blacklists, this is without ever seeing one and without the company admitting they had such things. But last year, Zach Vorhies left the company, quit the company and took with him 950 pages of documents and a video and two of those documents were Googles blacklists.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t understand how big this threat is, you mentioned that leak, that video that you exposed which was quite astonishing. One of the things that was said there by one of their top executives is \u2018we\u2019re going to use every means at our disposal, all of Google\u2019s power to make sure Trump isn\u2019t re-elected\u2019 so if they\u2019re using every single means at their disposal, then they\u2019re using all of the techniques that I\u2019ve discovered and probably more that I haven\u2019t discovered yet. That\u2019s enough to shift roughly ten percent of the voting population of the United States with no one knowing they\u2019re being manipulated and no paper trail for authorities to trace.\u201d\n\nDr. Epstein then outlined how he and his team fo researchers are developing a new monitoring system to track YouTube and the content that YouTube\u2019s algorithm is suggesting to users. \u201cWe will be capturing what they\u2019re doing in real-time as its occurring,\u201d said Epstein. \u201cNormally you can\u2019t do that, because think about it, when you do a search on Google or see a newsfeed on Facebook that\u2019s generated on-the-fly just for you, it affects you, it disappears and it\u2019s gone, it\u2019s not stored anywhere. So there\u2019s no trace of it, you can\u2019t go back in time and see what these companies are showing people, you can\u2019t see the manipulations as they\u2019re all ephemeral, they\u2019re fleeting.\u201d\n\nDr. Epstein has been at the forefront of tracking Google\u2019s election manipulation. At the Breitbart News Masters of the Universe Town Hall in 2018, Epstein warned that most Americans have \u201cno idea of the extent of the surveillance\u201d that Google and other tech companies perform on our daily lives.\n\nListen to the full interview with Dr. Epstein at Breitbart News Daily here.", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2020/07/10/dr-robert-epstein-google-will-shift-10-of-voters-to-make-trump-a-blip-in-history/", "published": "2020-07-10T00:00:00"}, {"title": "THE GOOGLE TAPE: Google Global Affairs VP Kent Walker \u2014 \u2018History Is on Our Side\u2019", "text": "Speaking to Google employees a few days after the 2016 election, Google VP for Global Affairs Kent Walker assured the company that despite Trump\u2019s election, history was \u201con [their] side\u201d but that they must work to ensure that \u201cpopulism [and] nationalism\u201d around the world is nothing more than a \u201cblip\u201d and a \u201chiccup\u201d in the march towards progress.\n\nThe comments were brought to light in a video leaked exclusively to Breitbart News by an anonymous source.

The \u201cinnovation city,\u201d located outside Moscow, has some 30,000 workers in state-of-the-art facilities under strict government control. \u2026 Clinton\u2019s State Dept. recruited U.S. tech giants like Google, Cisco, Intel. Indeed, out of 28 U.S., European, and Russian companies that participated in Skolkovo, 17 of them were Clinton Foundation donors or paid for speeches by Bill Clinton. However, as involvement in Skolkovo by Clinton cronies increased, so, too, did the danger for the technology coming out of the Russian tech mecca to be used for Russian military purposes.\n\nSolomon recalled the Obama administration\u2019s rationale for assisting Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s plans to develop a technological hub near Moscow. Former President Barack Obama and then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton sought to procure goodwill with the Kremlin by connecting the Russian government with U.S.-based technology companies.\n\n\u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s State Department was the lead on this,\u201d Solomon stated. \u201cJoe Biden was the architect of this. The idea was Russia is behind in the technology space, and if we help build them a technology economy, they\u2019ll stop stealing our stuff and be able to sustain themselves, and we\u2019ll have a friendly partner thousands of miles away in Moscow.

We are worried that this could be a change of trend.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe rise in cases across several countries follows weeks of stability that had ushered in a growing sense of normalcy. A wave of reopening measures had come and gone without significant ill effect. People went to movies, dined at restaurants and started working from offices again.\n\nBut some virologists had warned that openings would inevitably be followed by new infections. Others stressed that successful reopening was dependent on citizens wearing masks and maintaining social distance. And there are signs adherence has been slipping.\n\nOn the tree-lined streets of Brussels, masks have been a rare sight. In Berlin, famed for its 24-hour pre-pandemic party scene, police have struggled to break up crowds of weekend revelers who gather in parks and open spaces for illicit dance parties. Spanish nightclubs and beaches brimmed with vacationers after European travel restrictions eased.\n\n\u201cMore and more people are getting relaxed,\u201d said Dirk Brockmann, a professor at Berlin\u2019s Humboldt University who works on pandemic modeling with the Robert Koch Institute. \u201cPeople are wearing a face mask going shopping or on the subway, but other than that they are going back to normal.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe said that if the rise in infections was linked to reopenings rather than subsequent relaxed behavior, there would have been a stronger indication earlier.\n\nWhat happens now may similarly depend on human behavior, he added.\n\n\u201cPotentially people will change their behavior again and we will mitigate,\u201d he said.\n\nThe number of new cases is still far below what European countries saw during the peak of their outbreaks \u2014 or what is happening in the United States.\n\nGermany, for instance, recorded 633 new cases on Tuesday, compared with more than 6,000 daily cases at its peak. But German health authorities said the nature of the new infections is concerning, with outbreaks no longer largely confined to slaughterhouses or nursing homes.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cCorona is coming back with all its might,\u201d warned Bavarian state premier Markus S\u00f6der, according to German news site Merkur.\n\nAD\n\nIn France, new cases hit an average of 850 over the past three days \u2014 nowhere near the average of 2,582 in April. But the Health Ministry noted that recent progress has been erased, and Health Minister Olivier V\u00e9ran warned of as many as 500 active clusters.\n\nIn Belgium, cases suddenly started rising this month after declining consistently since April. There were 707 cases diagnosed nationwide the week of July 6. Just two weeks later, the figure had tripled to a level not seen since early May.\n\nBelgian policymakers are tightening restrictions. Customers are required to wear masks in stores. Starting Wednesday, Belgian households will be asked to limit consistent close social contact to no more than five people, down from 15. The maximum size of social gatherings, such as weddings, has been slashed to 10 people, down from 50. A country that had insouciantly planned to reopen schools without significant restrictions in September is now questioning whether that will happen.\n\n\u201cWhat is happening is a situation that is worrying, not terrifying,\u201d Belgian Prime Minister Sophie Wilm\u00e8s told Le Soir newspaper. However, she has warned that a second lockdown may be necessary.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere\u2019s debate about whether Europe might be at the beginning of a second wave. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson suggested as much on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be absolutely clear about what\u2019s happening in Europe, amongst some of our European friends. I\u2019m afraid you are starting to see in some places the signs of a second wave of the pandemic,\u201d he said.\n\nJohnson was defending an advisory against nonessential travel to Spain, where the region of Catalonia has reemerged as a hot spot, with thousands of new cases reported in the past two weeks. Spanish Health Minister Salvador Illa has largely linked new cases to seasonal farmworkers, people attending family get-togethers and nightclubs.\n\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t at the beginning of a second wave,\u201d said Pamela Vallely, a medical virologist from Manchester University. \u201cThis is just the continuation of the virus being in our communities.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nResurgences are \u201cjust what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are going to have to continue to try to contain things to levels we can cope with.\u201d\n\nBut as governments now have experience with how to cope with the virus, including tools such as localized lockdowns, testing and contact tracing, she said she doesn\u2019t envisage a large surge.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m relatively optimistic,\u201d she said."}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/afghanistan-taliban-eid-cease-fire-peace-talks/2020/07/28/f2a33c98-d0e1-11ea-826b-cc394d824e35_story.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=wp_world", "published": "2020-07-28T07:54:01", "title": "Taliban declares cease-fire in Afghanistan for Eid, as pressure builds for peace talks", "text": "The U.S. special envoy for Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, returned to the region this month to build momentum for direct talks between the two sides.

The Afghan government has only recently indicated it may be willing to release the 5,000 prisoners demanded by Taliban leadership as a precondition to talks. And the Taliban has said the group is open to direct talks after the Eid holiday, once the prisoner swap is complete.\n\nThe Taliban cease-fire announcement called on the group\u2019s fighters to \u201chalt offensive operations against enemy forces\u201d starting Friday during the three-day holiday. But if government forces attack, the statement said, \u201cthey must be met with a strong response.\u201d The statement also said the group\u2019s fighters are not permitted to travel to government-controlled territory.\n\nA cease-fire in 2018 was marked by extraordinary scenes of Taliban and government fighters crossing enemy lines to greet one another. Reports later emerged that the cessation of violence also led to large numbers of defections from the Taliban\u2019s ranks.\n\nDespite brief pauses in fighting, the war in Afghanistan remains one of the world\u2019s deadliest conflicts, according to a United Nations report released this week.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDuring the first half of this year, more than 1,200 civilians were killed and 2,100 injured. The Taliban and other anti-government militant groups were responsible for most of those casualties, according to the report.\n\nOverall, the numbers mark a decrease in civilian deaths and injuries when compared with the same period last year, but U.S. and Afghan government officials say the levels of violence remain too high. Following the signing of the peace deal with the Taliban, U.S. officials said they expected violence across the country to remain low. A week of reduced violence preceded the signing, prompting many to hope decades of deadly conflict had turned a corner.\n\nBut in the months that followed, the \u201creluctance\u201d on both sides to make concessions to facilitate direct talks suggests that once negotiations begin, they are likely to be a lengthy process, according to Scott Worden, director of the Afghanistan and Central Asia programs at the United States Institute for Peace.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt \u201cshows what difficult compromises may look like during talks,\u201d Worden said. \u201cEach side will have to give a little on core concerns. But much more difficult issues \u2014 rights, governance and power-sharing \u2014 lie ahead.\u201d\n\nThe agreement between the United States and the Taliban does not outline what form of government will rule postwar Afghanistan. Taliban leaders have said they are open to discussing issues of democracy and human rights, but some Afghans fear a power-sharing deal could undermine the country\u2019s fragile democracy.\n\nSeveral hours before the cease-fire announcement, the Taliban\u2019s leader, Hibatullah Akhundzada, issued a lengthy online statement addressed to \u201cthe Muslim Afghan nation,\u201d in which he declared that the insurgents are \u201con the threshold of establishing an Islamic government\u201d but do not seek a \u201cmonopoly over power\u201d and are also looking forward to intra-\n\nAfghan talks.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe called on insurgent fighters to \u201ctreat civilians with utmost care\u201d and \u201cconsider the protection\u201d of their fellow Afghans, to \u201cgive greater attention to obedience\u201d to God and to strengthen their \u201cinternal bond and cohesion\u201d in the ranks. These appeals appeared aimed at unifying and cautioning Taliban forces, in which some commanders have insisted on continuing to fight even as Taliban negotiators were discussing terms for peace.\n\nThe Afghan government has released more than 4,400 Taliban prisoners, according to the country\u2019s National Security Council. The Taliban says it has released more than 800 members of the Afghan security forces, but the government says the true number is fewer than 600 because many of those released were civilians."}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/hajj-somalia-livestock-exports/2020/07/28/10c984e6-d03a-11ea-826b-cc394d824e35_story.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=wp_world", "published": "2020-07-28T05:52:42", "title": "With drastically smaller hajj, Somalia\u2019s livestock industry goes from \u2018boom to doom\u2019", "text": "The coronavirus pandemic forced Saudi authorities to limit the hajj to just 1,000 people already in the kingdom, crushing the dreams of millions of pilgrims \u2014 and those of the livestock breeders, traders and exporters who supply millions of cows, camels, sheep and goats to feed the foreigners who arrive in the desert city each year.\n\nThat sudden drop in demand has been devastating for Somalia, where livestock makes up three-quarters of total exports, around 70 percent of which are sent to Saudi Arabia in the months leading up to the hajj.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSomalia\u2019s livestock exports are expected to decline by as much as half this year, according to the World Bank.\n\n\u201cWe are extending our hands to Allah, praying to take away the curse,\u201d said Abdi Omar Hashi, 52, a father of eight. He recently loaded hundreds of his animals in trucks and traveled nearly 700 miles with them from central Somalia to the northern port city of Bosaso, where most livestock is exported. \u201cWhen we got there, no one was buying. We had to bring them back.\u201d\n\nHashi said he has lost more than $50,000 this year, nearly all of his savings.\n\nThe shift has had dire consequences for livelihoods, especially among the poor. Livestock sales account for 60 percent of household income for much of the country\u2019s largely rural population, especially in regions such as Puntland, in the north, which is more arid.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe hajj season is essential. It is huge for us,\u201d said Somalia\u2019s livestock minister, Hussein Mohamud Sheikh Hussein. He said Somalia exported more than 1 million cows to Saudi Arabia during last year\u2019s pilgrimage. The end of hajj is marked by the festival of Eid al-Adha, which calls for the sacrifice of an animal, creating additional demand.\n\nMany Somalis take out loans to expand their herds and pay them back with income in the lead-up to the hajj boom. Now, many face deeper debt that may turn into a long-term drag on their income.\n\n\u201cIn a normal year this would be a time when those in the Somali livestock business would easily be able to pay off debts,\u201d said Ahmed Khalif, Somalia country director for the nonprofit Action Against Hunger, which is expecting the downturn to result in widespread food insecurity. \u201cBasically it went from boom to doom.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMany in the industry had taken out loans early this year. The exporting season begins about two months before the hajj \u2014 that would have been in May.\n\n\u201cThis tragedy, this virus, happened when we were on the brink of exporting,\u201d said Adow Abdullahi Ahmed, who has bought and sold livestock for more than three decades. \u201cI have had to sell some of my plots of land and animals to keep life going and keep my children in school.\u201d\n\nAction Against Hunger reports that the price for camels, for example, has dropped by nearly half, from $1,000 to $500. Ahmed said cows and goats have also gone down by around half. The downturn hits everyone from brokers and transporters to caretakers and exporters.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe overall impact on the country, on foreign exchange, on loss of taxes, the devaluation of currency, inflation \u2014 the ripple effects of this are huge,\u201d Khalif said. \u201cThey\u2019re everywhere.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe Somali economy is already in dire straits after decades of conflict and political turmoil. Natural factors such as cycles of drought and flooding, and now the pandemic with its border closures and damage to remittance flows, have further disintegrated financial stability for most.\n\n\u201cOur life depends on the livestock market,\u201d said Isse Muse, 55, a herder in the Eyl region of Puntland with 16 children. \u201cNow I am looking for loans to put some food on the table.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBecause so many Somalis rely on the livestock trade, there is a dip in spending power across the country, leading to a broader economic downturn. Even though meat has suddenly become less expensive, the people who rear animals for a living cannot afford it. Instead, many are saving their herds for next year, in hopes that the hajj will be back on in 2021.\n\nAD"}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/07/28/former-malaysian-prime-minister-najib-razak-found-guilty-corruption-trial-sentenced-12-years-prison/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=wp_world", "published": "2020-07-28T14:09:38", "title": "Former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak found guilty in corruption trial, sentenced to 12 years in prison", "text": "Najib vowed to appeal the verdict.

Melting permafrost shifted the foundation and ruptured a fuel reservoir, sending 21,000 tons of diesel into a fragile ecosystem of rivers and wetlands.\n\n[New climate study leans toward more dire warming scenarios]\n\n\u201cThe area should be declared an ecological disaster zone,\u201d said Roman Desyatkin, who studies permafrost and is based in the Siberian city of Yakutsk.\n\nVasily Ryabinin left his job as an inspector for Russia\u2019s environmental agency and began speaking out about the consequences of the fuel leak. (Yuri Kozyrev/NOOR)\n\n\u2018National pride\u2019\n\nRyabinin, who grew up in Norilsk, saw photos of the Daldykan and Ambarnaya rivers stained red with fuel. He decided to check it out for himself. He said security from the plant initially barred him and his boss from visiting the site, despite their working for a governmental agency. They accessed it from the railroad tracks instead, walking more than a mile to a bridge that crossed the river.\n\n\u201cWe started to smell it half a kilometer before the bridge,\u201d Ryabinin said. \u201cAnd then we saw just a flood of diesel in the river.\u201d\n\nFour days later, Putin went public about the spill. He berated both the regional governor and the head of the plant\u2019s subsidiary in a videoconference that was broadcast on state television \u2014 a rare public chiding. Some also saw it as underscoring Kremlin worries about its broader strategies in the region.\n\nThe spill \u201cwas a signal to the political governance of Russia that the Arctic is not a piece of cake,\u201d said Vladimir Chuprov, the project director for the Russian branch of Greenpeace. \u201cThe conditions are very harsh, and it\u2019s very expensive.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s a very political and national pride story, where the Arctic is recognized as the personal story of President Putin,\u201d he added.\n\nVasily Ryabinin said this photo was taken more than seven miles from the spill on the same day it occurred, indicating how quickly the pollution spread. (Vasily Ryabinin)\n\nThe Kremlin published its 15-year Arctic ambitions in March, outlining a plan to develop new energy projects and create tens of thousands of jobs that will lure new people to the Far North.\n\nThe document on the \u201cfoundations of state policy in the Arctic to 2035,\u201d signed by Putin, was an expression of Moscow\u2019s underlying philosophy: Russia is feeling the effects of climate change, but maybe it could use it to its advantage. Among the goals is to use the Northern Sea Route to export oil and gas as the waters increasingly become free of ice.\n\nThis year marked the earliest eastbound shipment of liquefied natural gas from the Russian Arctic to China along the Northern Sea Route. The vessel left in May \u2014 more than a month earlier than in previous years. This summer has featured what is very likely the earliest opening of the Northern Sea Route since reliable satellite monitoring began in the late 1970s, with ice disappearing along the Siberian coast.\n\n[Unprecedented heat in Siberia helped push globe to warmest June on record]\n\nOn shore, however, the warming climate could be limiting options for Russian officials, who are considering legislation to offer free plots of land to encourage people to relocate to the Arctic.\n\nLast month, a large crack emerged on a two-story residential building in Yakutsk, the world\u2019s largest city built on permafrost and about 5,000 miles east of Moscow. The building was sinking with the permafrost\u2019s thaw, forcing families to abandon their homes with no notice.\n\nMajor Russian energy producers such as Gazprom, Novatek and Norilsk Nickel could face a significant financial hit because of melting permafrost, according to a Morgan Stanley report obtained by the Russian business daily newspaper Vedomosti. The report noted that around 90 percent of Russia\u2019s gas and diamonds, 30 percent of its oil, and all of its palladium reserves are in areas covered by permafrost.\n\nA vast underground layer of ice and frozen dirt has been rapidly thawing as Siberia warms up faster than almost anywhere else on Earth. (Video by Michael Robinson Chavez)\n\nUnstable ground\n\nFor decades, scientists have been warning that as the world warms, the Arctic would warm faster than the rest of the globe.\n\nLess snow and sea ice to reflect sunlight, and darker land cover to soak it up, helps speed a process known as Arctic amplification. Right now, it\u2019s on overdrive.\n\nThe six months from January to June were more than 9 degrees (5 degrees Celsius) warmer than average over much of north-central Siberia, according to a new study.\n\n[Siberia's freakishly mild weather is reverberating around the globe]\n\nThis is having a host of ripple effects on the vast region and in fact the rest of the globe. Melting permafrost frees up huge quantities of planet-warming greenhouse gases that had been locked away in partially decomposed organic matter for thousands of years.\n\nVladimir Romanovsky, a climate researcher at the University of Alaska at Fairbanks who closely studies permafrost, said the Norilsk spill should be a wake-up call for political leaders in Russia and other Arctic nations on the consequences of thawing permafrost.\n\nA 100.4-degree reading in the small community of Verkhoyansk, north of the Arctic Circle, on June 20 underscored the urgency of permafrost destabilization, he said. That reading may be certified as the hottest temperature recorded above the Arctic Circle.\n\nMeanwhile, Arctic wildfire emissions, driven primarily by Siberian fires, hit a record level in July, according to the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service, a European Union science agency based in Reading, England. These blazes are harming permafrost indirectly by removing the cold, wet vegetation that covers the ground in these areas, such as peat.\n\n[Arctic sea ice is in a downward spiral]\n\n\u201cScientists always were warning about this coming, but, of course, politicians and policymakers, they need to see something happen,\u201d Romanovsky said. \u201cJust warnings are not enough to take it seriously.\u201d\n\nHe helped write a 2018 study that found that one-third of pan-Arctic infrastructure \u2014 and nearly 50 percent of oil and gas fields in the Russian Arctic \u2014 is located in areas where permafrost thaw could seriously damage infrastructure by 2050.\n\nRomanovsky now says the study\u2019s results may have been too conservative.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just physical law that in a warmer climate, the permafrost will thaw and create these critical situations in more and more regions,\u201d he said.\n\nNorilsk Nickel was fined $2.1 billion by the Russian government for damage caused by the diesel contamination. (Vasily Ryabinin)\n\nFuel spill fallout\n\nRyabinin\u2019s clandestine visit to the Daldykan River on May 29 was what he described as the \u201clast straw.\u201d\n\nNorilsk was built by gulag prisoners in the Soviet Union, and the industrial city of around 175,000 people, for whom Norilsk Nickel is the main employer, is now notorious for its pollution.

(Yuri Kozyrev/NOOR)\n\nNorilsk Nickel, the world\u2019s leading producer of nickel and palladium, was hit with a $2.1 billion fine for the damage. In a statement, the company said it is appealing the amount.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, Nornickel reiterates its commitment to fully cover the cost of remediation of the environmental impact of this accident,\u201d the statement said.\n\nLess than two months after the 21,000-ton spill, Norilsk Nickel acknowledged a second, smaller leak inside the Arctic Circle \u2014 45 tons of jet fuel escaping a pipeline in the Krasnoyarsk region. Incidents like that are common, environmentalists said, but usually don\u2019t get the same publicity as the big one in Norilsk.\n\n\u2018On the agenda\u2019\n\nThe Kremlin\u2019s 15-year plans include the development of scientific and engineering solutions to \u201cprevent infrastructure damage from global climate change,\u201d but they aren\u2019t clearly defined. Greenpeace\u2019s Chuprov said the costs of Putin\u2019s full Arctic development plans may be too much for his government to swallow.\n\n\u201cAll of these ideas reflected in all of these [Kremlin] papers are not workable,\u201d he said.\n\nRomanovsky, the climate researcher at the University of Alaska, said new buildings need to be constructed with melting permafrost in mind. One option is to elevate buildings to try to let cold air move under them and maintain more permafrost cover.\n\nChuprov is pessimistic that the Norilsk spill alone will cause Russia to make sweeping changes to its Arctic plans. He pointed to oil giant Rosneft, run by close Putin ally Igor Sechin, which recently asked for the government\u2019s blessing to drill at least three sites that are partly located within the borders of a protected nature reserve in the Taymyr Peninsula, according to the Kommersant newspaper.\n\nIt\u2019s now unclear whether Rosneft will get the go-ahead.\n\n\u201cAll of these ecological issues were always secondary and never a priority,\u201d said Shakhmatov, the director of the Russia Greens ecological party. \u201cNow the ecological issues are on the agenda, and they\u2019re in the top three.\u201d\n\nFreedman reported from Washington."}]}, "theonion": {"link": "http://www.theonion.com/", "articles": []}}}
